[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=10) by Florence Scovel Shinn,
[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=13) read by Sarah Partridge.

[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=30) Chapter one, &quot;The Game&quot;.
[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=33) &quot;Most people consider life a battle,
[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=36) but it is not a battle, it is a game.
[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=39) It is a game, however,
[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=40) which cannot be played successfully
[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=42) without the knowledge of spiritual law
[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=45) and the Old and New Testaments
[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=47) give the rules of the game
with wonderful clearness.
[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=50) Jesus Christ taught
that it was a great game
[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=53) of giving and receiving.
[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=55) Whatsoever a man soweth
that shall he also reap.
[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=60) This means that whatever
man sends out in word
[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=63) or deed will return to him.
[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=65) What he gives, he will receive.
[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=68) If he gives hate, he will receive hate.
[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=71) If he gives love, he will receive love.
[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=74) If he gives criticism, he
will receive criticism.
[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=78) If he lies, he will be lied to.
[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=81) If he cheats, he will be cheated.
[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=84) We are taught also that
the imaging faculty
[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=87) plays a leading part in the game of life.
[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=90) &#39;Keep thy heart or
imagination with all diligence
[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=94) for out of it are the issues of life.&#39;
[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=97) Proverbs 4:23.
[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=100) This means that what man images,
[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=102) sooner or later
externalizes in his affairs.
[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=106) I know of a man who
feared a certain disease.
[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=110) It was a very rare disease
and difficult to get,
[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=113) but he pictured it
continually and read about it
[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=115) until it manifested in
his body and he died.
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=119) The victim of distorted imagination.
[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=122) So, we see to play
successfully the game of life,
[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=126) we must train the imaging faculty.
[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=129) A person with an imaging faculty
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=130) trained to image only
good brings into his life
[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=134) every righteous desire of his heart.
[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=136) Health, wealth, love, friends.
[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=140) Perfect self-expression
his highest ideals.
[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=144) The imagination has been called,
[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=146) &quot;The Scissors of The Mind&quot;,
[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=148) and it is ever cutting.
[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=150) Cutting day by day the
pictures man sees there
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=153) and sooner or later he
meets his own creations
[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=156) in his outer world.
[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=158) To train the imagination successfully,
[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=161) man must understand the
workings of his mind.
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=164) The Greeks said, &quot;Know thyself.&quot;
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=167) There are three departments of the mind,
[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=169) the subconscious, conscious
and super conscious.
[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=173) The subconscious is simply
power without direction.
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=177) It is like steam or electricity
[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=179) and it does what it is directed to do,
[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=181) it has no power of induction.
[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=184) Whatever man feels
deeply or images clearly,
[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=187) is impressed upon the subconscious mind
[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=189) and carried out in minutest detail.
[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=192) For example, a woman I know, when a child,
[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=196) always made believe she was a widow.
[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=198) She dressed up in black clothes
[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=200) and wore a long black veil
[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=202) and people thought she was
very clever and amusing.
[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=205) She grew up and married a man
[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=207) with whom she was deeply in love.
[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=209) In a short time, he died
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=211) and she wore black and a
sweeping veil for many years.
[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=215) The picture of herself as a widow
[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=217) was impressed upon the subconscious mind
[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=220) and in due time, worked itself out,
[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=223) regardless of the havoc created.
[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=226) The conscious mind has been called mortal
[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=228) or carnal mind.
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=230) It is the human mind and sees
life as it appears to be.
[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=234) It sees death, disaster, sickness, poverty
[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=238) and limitation of every kind
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=240) and it impresses the sub-conscious.
[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=243) The super-conscious mind
[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=244) is the God mind within each man
[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=247) and is the realm of perfect ideas.
[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=249) In it, is the perfect
pattern spoken of by Plato,
[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=253) &quot;The Divine Design&quot;,
[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=254) for there is a divine
design for each person.
[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=257) There is a place that you are to fill
[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=259) and no one else can fill,
[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=261) something you are to do,
[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=263) which no one else can do.
[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=265) There is a perfect picture of this
[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=267) in the super-conscious mind.
[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=269) It usually flashes across the conscious
[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=271) as an unattainable ideal,
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=273) something too good to be true.
[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=276) In reality, it is man&#39;s
true destiny or destination
[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=280) flashed to him from the
infinite intelligence
[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=283) which is within himself.
[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=285) Many people, however, are in ignorance
[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=287) of their true destinies
[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=289) and are striving for things and situations
[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=292) which do not belong to them
[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=293) and would only bring failure
[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=295) and dissatisfaction if attained.
[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=298) For example, a woman came to me
[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=300) and asked me to speak the word
[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=302) that she would marry a certain man
[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=304) with whom she was very much in love.
[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=306) She called him A. B.
[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=308) I replied that this would be a violation
[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=310) of spiritual law,
[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=312) but that I would speak the word
[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=313) for the right man, the divine selection,
[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=316) the man who belonged
to her by divine right.
[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=319) I added, &#39;If A. B. is the right man,
[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=321) you can&#39;t lose him
[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=322) and if he isn&#39;t,
[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=323) you will receive his equivalent.&#39;
[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=325) She saw A. B. frequently
[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=327) but no headway was made
in their friendship.
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=330) One evening she called and said,
[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=332) &#39;Do you know, for the last week,
[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=334) A. B. hasn&#39;t seemed so wonderful to me.&#39;
[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=337) I replied, &#39;Maybe he is
not the divine selection.
[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=341) Another man may be the right one.&#39;
[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=343) Soon after that, she met another man
[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=346) who fell in love with her at once
[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=348) and who said she was his ideal.
[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=350) In fact, he said all the things
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=352) that she had always wished
A. B. would say to her.
[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=356) She remarked, &#39;It was quite uncanny.&#39;
[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=359) She soon returned his love
[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=360) and lost all interest in A. B.
[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=363) This shows the law of substitution.
[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=366) A right idea was
substituted for a wrong one,
[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=369) therefore there was no
loss or sacrifice involved.
[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=373) Jesus Christ said, &#39;Seek
ye first the Kingdom of God
[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=377) and his righteousness
[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=378) and all these things
shall be added unto you&#39;
[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=382) and he said the Kingdom was within man.
[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=385) The Kingdom is the realm of right ideas
[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=387) or the divine pattern.
[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=389) Jesus Christ taught that man&#39;s words
[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=392) played a leading part in the game of life.
[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=395) &#39;By your words, ye are justified
[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=397) and by your words, ye are condemned.&#39;
[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=400) Many people have brought disaster
[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=402) into their lives through idle words.
[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=404) For example, a woman once asked me
[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=407) why her life was now one
of poverty, of limitation.
[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=411) Formerly, she had a home,
[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=413) was surrounded by beautiful things
[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=415) and had plenty of money.
[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=416) We found she had often tired
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=418) of the management of her home
[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=420) and had said repeatedly,
[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=422) &#39;I&#39;m sick and tired of things,
[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=424) I wish I lived in a trunk&#39;
[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=426) and she added, &#39;Today I
am living in that trunk.&#39;
[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=429) She had spoken herself into a trunk.
[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=432) The subconscious mind
has no sense of humor
[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=435) and people often joke themselves
[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=437) into unhappy experiences.
[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=440) For example, a woman who
had a great deal of money,
[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=443) joked continually about getting
ready for the poorhouse.
[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=447) In a few years, she was almost destitute,
[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=449) having impressed the subconscious mind
[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=452) with a picture of lack and limitation.
[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=455) Fortunately, the law works both ways
[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=457) and a situation of lack may be changed
[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=460) to one of plenty.
[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=462) For example, a woman came
to me one hot summer&#39;s day
[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=465) for a treatment for prosperity.
[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=468) She was worn out,
dejected and discouraged.
[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=471) She said she possessed
just $8 in the world.
[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=474) I said, &#39;Good, we&#39;ll bless the $8
[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=476) and multiply them as
Jesus Christ multiplied
[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=480) the loaves and the fishes,&#39;
[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=482) for He taught that every
man had the power to bless
[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=485) and to multiply, to heal and to prosper.
[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=488) She said, &#39;What shall I do next?&#39;
[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=491) I replied, &#39;Follow intuition.
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=494) Have you a hunch to do
anything or to go anywhere?&#39;
[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=497) Intuition means, intuition
[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=499) or to be taught from within.
[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=502) It is man&#39;s unerring guide
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=504) and I will deal more fully with its laws
[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=506) in a following chapter.
[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=508) The woman replied, &#39;I don&#39;t know.
[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=510) I seem to have a hunch to go home,
[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=513) I&#39;ve just enough money for carfare.&#39;
[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=515) Her home was in a distant city
[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=517) and was one of lack and limitation
[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=519) and the reasoning mind or
intellect would have said,
[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=522) &#39;Stay in New York and get
work and make some money.&#39;
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=525) I replied, &#39;Then go home,
never violate a hunch.&#39;
[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=529) I spoke the following words for her,
[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=531) &#39;Infinite Spirit, open the
way for great abundance for.
[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=536) She is an irresistible magnet
[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=538) for all that belongs to
her by divine right.&#39;
[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=541) I told her to repeat it continually also.
[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=544) She left for home immediately.
[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=546) In calling on a woman one day,
[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=548) she linked up with an
old friend of her family.
[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=551) Through this friend,
[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=552) she received thousands of dollars
[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=554) in a most miraculous way.
[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=557) She has said to me often,
[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=558) &#39;Tell people about the
woman who came to you
[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=560) with $8 and a hunch.&#39;
[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=563) There is always plenty on man&#39;s pathway,
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=566) but it can only be
brought into manifestation
[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=569) through desire, faith or the spoken word.
[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=573) Jesus Christ brought out clearly
[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=575) that man must make the first move.
[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=577) &#39;Ask and it shall be given you,
[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=580) seek and ye shall find,
[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=582) knock and it shall be opened unto you,&#39;
[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=586) Matthew 7:7.
[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=588) In the scriptures we read,
[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=589) &#39;Concerning the works of my hands,
[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=592) command ye me.&#39;
[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=594) Infinite intelligence, God,
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=597) is ever ready to carry out man&#39;s smallest
[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=599) or greatest demands.
[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=601) Every desire, uttered or unexpressed,
[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=604) is a demand.
[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=605) We are often startled
[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=607) by having a wish suddenly fulfilled.
[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=609) For example, one Easter,
[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=611) having seen many beautiful rose trees
[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=614) in the florists&#39; windows,
[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=615) I wished I would receive one
[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=618) and for an instant,
[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=619) saw it mentally being carried in the door.
[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=622) Easter came and with it
a beautiful rose-tree.
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=626) I thanked my friend the following day
[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=628) and told her it was
just what I had wanted.
[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=631) She replied, &quot;I didn&#39;t
send you a rose-tree,
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=633) I sent you lilies!&quot;
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=635) The man had mixed the order
[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=637) and sent me a rose-tree
[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=639) simply because I had
started the law in action
[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=642) and I had to have a rose-tree.
[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=644) Nothing stands between
man and his highest ideals
[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=647) and every desire of his heart,
[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=649) but doubt and fear.
[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=651) When man can wish without worrying,
[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=653) every desire will be instantly fulfilled.
[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=657) I will explain more fully
in a following chapter
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=659) the scientific reason for this
[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=661) and how fear must be erased
from the consciousness.
[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=665) It is man&#39;s only enemy,
[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=667) fear of lack, fear of failure,
[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=669) fear of sickness, fear of loss
[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=672) and a feeling of insecurity on some plane.
[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=675) Jesus Christ said, &quot;Why are ye fearful,
[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=678) oh ye of little faith?&quot;
[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=680) Matthew 8:26.
[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=683) So, we can see we must
substitute faith for fear,
[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=686) for fear is only inverted faith,
[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=689) it is faith in evil instead of good.
[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=692) The object of the game of life
[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=694) is to see clearly one&#39;s good
[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=696) and to obliterate all
mental pictures of evil.
[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=699) This must be done by impressing
the subconscious mind
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=702) with a realization of good.
[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=704) A very brilliant man, who
has attained great success,
[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=708) told me he had suddenly erased all fear
[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=711) from his consciousness by reading a sign
[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=713) which hung in a room.
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=715) He saw printed, in large
letters this statement,
[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=718) &#39;Why worry, it will
probably never happen.&#39;
[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=722) These words were stamped indelibly
[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=724) upon his subconscious mind
[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=726) and he has now a firm conviction
[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=728) that only good can come into his life,
[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=731) therefore only good can manifest.
[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=735) In the following chapter,
[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=736) I will deal with the different methods
[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=738) of impressing the subconscious mind.
[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=740) It is man&#39;s faithful servant,
[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=742) but one must be careful
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=743) to give it the right orders.
[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=745) Man has ever a silent
listener at his side,
[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=748) his subconscious mind.
[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=751) Every thought, every
word is impressed upon it
[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=754) and carried out in amazing detail.
[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=757) It is like a singer making a record
[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=759) on the sensitive disc of
the phonographic plate.
[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=762) Every note and tone
[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=763) of the singer&#39;s voice is registered.
[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=765) If he coughs or hesitates,
it is registered also.
[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=769) So, let us break all the old bad records
[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=772) in the subconscious mind,
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=774) the records of our lives
which we do not wish to keep
[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=777) and make new and beautiful ones.
[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=780) Speak these words aloud
with power and conviction,
[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=784) &quot;I now smash and demolish
by my spoken word,
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=788) every untrue record in
my subconscious mind.
[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=791) They shall return to the dust-heap
[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=793) of their native nothingness,
[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=795) for they came from my own vain imaginings.
[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=798) I now make my perfect records
[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=800) through the Christ within;
[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=802) the records of health, wealth, love
[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=805) and perfect self-expression.&quot;
[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=807) This is the square of life.
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=810) The game completed.
[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=812) In the following chapters,
[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=814) I will show how man can
change his conditions
[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=816) by changing his words.
[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=819) Any man who does not know
the power of the word,
[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=822) is behind the times.
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=823) &#39;Death and Life are in
the power of the tongue.&#39;
[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=827) Proverbs 18:21.
[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=831) Chapter two, &quot;The Law of Prosperity&quot;.
[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=835) &quot;Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense
[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=838) and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=842) One of the greatest
messages given to the race
[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=844) through the scriptures is
that God is man&#39;s supply
[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=848) and that man can release,
[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=849) through his spoken word,
[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=851) all that belongs to him by divine right.
[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=854) He must, however, have perfect faith
[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=857) in his spoken word.
[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=859) Isaiah said, &#39;My word shall
not return unto me void,
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=863) but shall accomplish that
where unto it is sent.&#39;
[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=867) We know now, that words and thoughts
[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=870) are a tremendous vibratory force,
[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=872) ever moulding man&#39;s body and affairs.
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=876) A woman came to me in great distress
[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=879) and said she was to be sued
[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=881) on the 15th of the month for $3,000.
[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=884) She knew no way of getting the money
[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=886) and was in despair.
[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=888) I told her God was her supply
[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=891) and that there is a
supply for every demand.
[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=894) So, I spoke the word!
[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=896) I gave thanks that the
woman would receive $3,000
[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=899) at the right time in the right way.
[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=902) I told her she must have perfect faith
[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=904) and act her perfect faith.
[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=906) The 15th came but no
money had materialized.
[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=910) She called me on the phone
[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=912) and asked what she was to do.
[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=914) I replied, &#39;It is Saturday,
[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=916) so they won&#39;t sue you today.
[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=918) Your part is to act rich,
[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=920) thereby showing perfect faith
[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=922) that you will receive it by Monday.&#39;
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=924) She asked me to lunch with her
[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=926) to keep up her courage.
[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=928) When I joined her at a restaurant, I said,
[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=929) &#39;This is no time to economize.
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=932) Order an expensive luncheon,
[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=934) act as if you have already
received the $3,000.&#39;
[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=938) All things whatsoever ye ask in prayer,
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=941) believing, ye shall receive.
[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=944) You must act as if you
had already received.
[15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=947) The next morning she
called me on the phone
[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=950) and asked me to stay
with her during the day.
[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=952) I said, &#39;No, you are divinely protected
[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=955) and God is never too late.&#39;
[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=958) In the evening she phoned
again, greatly excited
[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=961) and said, &#39;My dear, a
miracle has happened!
[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=964) I was sitting in my room this morning,
[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=966) when the door bell rang.
[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=967) I said to the maid, don&#39;t let anyone in.
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=970) The maid however, looked
out the window and said,
[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=972) It&#39;s your cousin with
the long white beard.&#39;
[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=975) So, I said, &#39;Call him back,
[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=977) I would like to see him.&#39;
[16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=979) He was just turning the corner
[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=980) when he heard the maid&#39;s
voice and he came back.
[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=983) He talked for about an hour
[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=985) and just as he was leaving he said,
[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=987) &#39;Oh, by the way, how are finances?&#39;
[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=990) I told him I needed the money and he said,
[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=992) &#39;Why, my dear, I will give you $3,000
[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=996) the first of the month.&#39;
[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=997) I didn&#39;t like to tell him
I was going to be sued.
[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1000) What shall I do?
[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1001) I won&#39;t receive it till
the first of the month
[16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1003) and I must have it tomorrow.
[16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1006) I said, &#39;I&#39;ll keep on treating.&#39;
[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1008) I said, &#39;Spirit is never too late.
[16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1011) I give thanks she has received the money
[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1013) on the invisible plane
[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1014) and that it manifests on time.&#39;
[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1017) The next morning her cousin called her up
[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1020) and said, &#39;Come to my office this morning
[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1022) and I will give you the money.&#39;
[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1023) That afternoon, she had $3,000
[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1026) to her credit in the bank
[17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1027) and wrote checks as rapidly
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1029) as her excitement would permit.
[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1032) If one asks for success
and prepares for failure,
[17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1036) he will get the situation
he has prepared for.
[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1039) For example, a man came to me asking me
[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1042) to speak the word that a certain debt
[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1044) would be wiped out.
[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1046) I found he spent his time planning
[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1048) what he would say to the man
[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1049) when he did not pay his bill,
[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1051) thereby neutralizing my words.
[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1053) He should have seen
himself paying the debt.
[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1057) We have a wonderful illustration
[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1058) of this in the bible,
[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1059) relating to the three kings
who were in the desert
[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1062) without water for their men and horses.
[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1065) They consulted the prophet Elisha,
[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1067) who gave them this astonishing message,
[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1070) &#39;Thus saith the Lord,
ye shall not see wind,
[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1074) neither shall ye see rain,
[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1077) yet make this valley full of ditches.&#39;
[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1080) Man must prepare for the
thing he has asked for,
[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1084) when there isn&#39;t the
slightest sign of it in sight.
[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1087) For example, a woman found it necessary
[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1090) to look for an apartment during the year
[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1092) when there was a great
shortage of apartments
[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1094) in New York.
[18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1095) It was considered almost an impossibility
[18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1098) and her friends were
sorry for her and said,
[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1100) &#39;Isn&#39;t it too bad you&#39;ll
have to store your furniture
[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1103) and live in a hotel?&#39;
[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1105) She replied, &#39;You needn&#39;t
feel sorry for me,
[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1108) I&#39;m a superman and I&#39;ll get an apartment.&#39;
[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1111) She spoke the words, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1114) open the way for the right apartment.&#39;
[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1116) She knew there was a
supply for every demand
[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1119) and that she was unconditioned,
[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1121) working on the spiritual plane
[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1123) and that one with God is a majority.
[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1126) She had contemplated buying new blankets,
[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1128) when the tempter, the adverse thought
[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1130) or reasoning mind suggested,
[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1132) &#39;Don&#39;t buy the blankets,
[18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1134) perhaps, after all, you
won&#39;t get an apartment
[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1137) and you will have no use for them.&#39;
[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1139) She promptly replied to herself,
[19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1141) &#39;I&#39;ll dig my ditches by
buying the blankets!&#39;
[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1144) So, she prepared for the apartment,
[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1146) acted as though she already had it.
[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1149) She found one in a miraculous way
[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1151) and it was given to her,
[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1153) although there were over two
hundred other applicants.
[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1156) The blankets showed active faith.
[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1159) It is needless to say that the ditches dug
[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1161) by the three kings in the desert
[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1163) were filled to over-flowing.
[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1165) Read II Kings.
[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1168) Getting into the spiritual swing of things
[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1170) is no easy matter for the average person.
[19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1173) The adverse thoughts of doubt and fear
[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1175) surge from the subconscious.
[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1177) They are the army of the aliens
[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1179) which must be put to flight.
[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1181) This explains why it is so often,
[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1184) darkest before the dawn.
[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1186) A big demonstration is usually preceded
[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1189) by tormenting thoughts.
[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1191) Having made a statement
of high spiritual truth,
[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1194) one challenges the old
beliefs in the subconscious
[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1197) and error is exposed to be put out.
[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1201) This is the time when one must make
[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1203) his affirmations of truth
repeatedly and rejoice
[20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1207) and give thanks that he
has already received.
[20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1209) &#39;Before ye call, I shall answer.&#39;
[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1213) This means that every
good and perfect gift
[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1215) is already man&#39;s awaiting his recognition.
[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1219) Man can only receive
[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1220) what he sees himself receiving.
[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1223) The children of Israel were told
[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1225) that they could have all
the land they could see.
[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1228) This is true of every man.
[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1230) He has only the land within
his own mental vision.
[20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1233) Every great work, every
big accomplishment,
[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1236) has been brought into manifestation
[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1238) through holding to the vision
[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1240) and often just before the big achievement,
[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1243) comes apparent failure and discouragement.
[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1246) The children of Israel when they reached
[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1248) the Promised Land were afraid to go in
[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1250) for they said it was filled with giants
[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1252) who made them feel like grasshoppers.
[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1254) &#39;And there we saw the giants
[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1257) and we were in our own
sight as grasshoppers.&#39;
[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1260) This is almost every man&#39;s experience.
[21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1262) However, the one who knows spiritual law,
[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1266) is undisturbed by appearance
[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1268) and rejoices while he is yet in captivity.
[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1272) That is, he holds to his vision
[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1274) and gives thanks that
the end is accomplished,
[21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1276) he has received.
[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1278) Jesus Christ gave a
wonderful example of this.
[21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1281) He said to his disciples,
[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1283) &#39;Say not ye, there are yet four months
[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1287) and then cometh the harvest?
[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1289) Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes
[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1292) and look on the fields,
[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1294) for they are ripe already to harvest.&#39;
[21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1297) His clear vision pierced
the world of matter
[21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1301) and he saw clearly the
fourth dimensional world,
[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1304) things as they really are,
[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1306) perfect and complete in divine mind.
[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1309) So, man must ever hold the vision
[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1311) of his journey&#39;s end
[21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1312) and demand the manifestation
[21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1314) of that which he has already received.
[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1317) It may be his perfect health, love,
[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1320) supply, self-expression, home or friends.
[22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1324) They are all finished and perfect ideas
[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1327) registered in divine mind,
[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1329) man&#39;s own super-conscious mind
[22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1331) and must come through him, not to him.
[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1334) For example, a man came to me asking
[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1337) for treatments for success.
[22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1339) It was imperative that he raise,
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1341) within a certain time,
$50,000 for his business.
[22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1345) The time limit was almost up
[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1347) when he came to me in despair.
[22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1349) No one wanted to invest in his enterprise
[22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1352) and the bank had flatly refused a loan.
[22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1355) I replied, &#39;I suppose you lost your temper
[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1358) while at the bank, therefore your power.
[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1360) You can control any situation
[22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1362) if you first control yourself.
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1365) Go back to the bank,&#39; I
added &#39;and I will treat.&#39;
[22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1368) My treatment was, &#39;You
are identified in love
[22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1371) with the spirit of everyone connected
[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1373) with the bank.
[22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1375) Let the divine idea come
out of this situation.&#39;
[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1378) He replied, &#39;Woman, you are talking
[23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1380) about an impossibility.
[23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1382) Tomorrow is Saturday,
the bank closes at 12
[23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1384) and my train won&#39;t get me there until 10
[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1387) and the time limit is up tomorrow
[23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1389) and anyway they won&#39;t do it.
[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1390) It&#39;s too late.&#39;
[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1392) I replied, &#39;God doesn&#39;t need any time
[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1395) and is never too late.
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1397) With Him, all things are possible.&#39;
[23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1400) I added, &#39;I don&#39;t know
anything about business,
[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1403) but I know all about God.&#39;
[23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1405) He replied, &#39;It all sounds fine
[23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1407) when I sit here listening to you,
[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1409) but when I go out, it&#39;s terrible.&#39;
[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1411) He lived in a distant city
[23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1413) and I did not hear from him for a week,
[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1416) then came a letter, it read,
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1418) &#39;You were right, I raised the money
[23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1421) and will never again doubt the truth
[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1423) of all that you told me.&#39;
[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1425) I saw him a few weeks later and I said,
[23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1428) &#39;What happened?
[23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1429) You evidently had plenty
of time, after all.&#39;
[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1432) He replied, &#39;My train was late
[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1435) and I got there just 15 minutes to 12.
[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1438) I walked into the bank quietly and said,
[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1440) I have come for the loan
[24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1442) and they gave it to me
without a question.&#39;
[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1445) It was the last 15 minutes
[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1447) of the time allotted to him
[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1448) and Infinite Spirit was not too late.
[24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1451) In this instance,
[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1452) the man could never
have demonstrated alone.
[24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1455) He needed someone to help
him hold to the vision.
[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1458) This is what one man can do for another.
[24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1462) Jesus Christ knew the
truth of this when he said,
[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1464) &#39;If two of you shall agree on earth
[24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1467) as touching anything that they shall ask,
[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1470) it shall be done for them of my Father
[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1472) which is in heaven.&#39;
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1474) One gets too close to his own affairs
[24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1476) and becomes doubtful and fearful.
[24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1479) The friend or healer
sees clearly the success,
[24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1483) health or prosperity and never wavers,
[24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1486) because he is not close to the situation.
[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1489) It is much easier to demonstrate
[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1491) for someone else than for one&#39;s self.
[24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1493) So, a person should not
hesitate to ask for help,
[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1496) if he feels himself wavering.
[24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1499) A keen observer of life once said,
[25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1501) &#39;No man can fail
[25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1503) if some one person sees him successful.&#39;
[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1507) Such is the power of the vision
[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1509) and many a great man has owed his success
[25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1512) to a wife or sister or a friend
[25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1515) who believed in him
[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1516) and held without wavering
[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1518) to the perfect pattern.&quot;
[25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1522) Chapter three, &quot;The Power of the Word&quot;.
[25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1526) &quot;By thy words thou shalt be justified
[25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1529) and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
[25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1533) A person knowing the power of the word
[25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1535) becomes very careful of his conversation.
[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1538) He has only to watch the
reaction of his words
[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1541) to know that they do not return void.
[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1544) Through his spoken word,
[25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1546) man is continually
making laws for himself.
[25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1549) I knew a man who said,
&#39;I always miss a car.
[25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1553) It invariably pulls out just as I arrive.&#39;
[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1556) His daughter said, &#39;I always catch a car.
[26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1560) It&#39;s sure to come just as I get there.&#39;
[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1562) This occurred for years.
[26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1564) Each had made a separate law for himself;
[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1566) one of failure, one of success.
[26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1569) This is the psychology of superstitions.
[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1572) The horse-shoe or rabbit&#39;s
foot contains no power,
[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1576) but man&#39;s spoken word
[26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1577) and belief that it will
bring him good luck
[26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1580) creates expectancy in
the subconscious mind
[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1583) and attracts a lucky situation.
[26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1586) I find however, this will not work
[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1589) when man has advanced spiritually
[26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1591) and knows a higher law.
[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1593) One cannot turn back
[26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1595) and must put away graven images.
[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1598) For example, two men in my class
[26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1600) had had great success in business
[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1603) for several months,
[26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1604) when suddenly everything went to smash.
[26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1608) We tried to analyze the situation
[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1610) and I found, instead of
making their affirmations
[26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1613) and looking to God for
success and prosperity,
[26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1616) they had each bought a lucky monkey.
[26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1619) I said, &#39;Oh I see, you have been trusting
[27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1622) in the lucky monkeys instead of God.
[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1625) Put away the lucky monkeys
[27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1626) and call on the law of forgiveness,
[27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1628) for man has power to forgive
[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1630) or neutralize his mistakes.&#39;
[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1633) They decided to throw the
lucky monkeys down a coal hole
[27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1637) and all went well again.
[27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1639) This does not mean, however,
[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1640) that one should throw
away every lucky ornament
[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1643) or horse-shoe about the house,
[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1646) but he must recognize
that the power back of it
[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1649) is the one and only power, God
[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1651) and that the object simply gives him
[27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1653) a feeling of expectancy.
[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1656) I was with a friend one day
[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1658) who was in deep despair.
[27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1660) In crossing the street,
she picked up a horseshoe.
[27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1663) Immediately, she was
filled with joy and hope.
[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1667) She said God had sent her the horseshoe
[27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1669) in order to keep up her courage.
[27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1671) It was indeed, at that moment,
[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1673) about the only thing that
could have registered
[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1675) in her consciousness.
[27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1677) Her hope became faith
[27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1679) and she ultimately made a
wonderful demonstration.
[28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1682) I wish to make the point clear
[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1684) that the men previously mentioned
[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1686) were depending on the monkeys alone,
[28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1689) while this woman recognized the power back
[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1691) of the horse-shoe.
[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1693) I know, in my own case,
it took a long while
[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1696) to get out of a belief
[28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1697) that a certain thing
brought disappointment.
[28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1700) If the thing happened,
[28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1701) disappointment invariably followed.
[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1704) I found the only way I could make a change
[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1707) in the subconscious, was by asserting,
[28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1709) &#39;There are not two powers,
[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1712) there is only one power, God,
[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1714) therefore, there are no disappointments
[28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1717) and this thing means a happy surprise.&#39;
[28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1720) I noticed a change at once
[28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1722) and happy surprises
commenced coming my way.
[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1726) I have a friend who said nothing
[28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1728) could induce her to walk under a ladder.
[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1730) I said, &#39;If you are afraid,
[28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1732) you are giving in to a
belief in two powers,
[28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1735) good and evil, instead of one.
[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1739) As God is absolute,
[29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1740) there can be no opposing power,
[29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1742) unless man makes the
false of evil for himself.
[29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1746) To show you believe in only one power, God
[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1749) and that there is no
power or reality in evil,
[29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1752) walk under the next ladder you see.&#39;
[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1755) Soon after, she went to her bank.
[29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1758) She wished to open her box
in the safe-deposit vault
[29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1761) and there stood a ladder on her pathway.
[29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1764) It was impossible to reach the box
[29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1766) without passing under the ladder.
[29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1768) She quailed with fear and turned back.
[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1771) She could not face the
lion on her pathway.
[29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1774) However, when she reached the street,
[29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1777) my words rang in her ears
[29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1779) and she decided to
return and walk under it.
[29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1782) It was a big moment in her life,
[29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1784) for ladders had held her
in bondage for years.
[29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1788) She retraced her steps to the vault
[29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1790) and the ladder was no longer there!
[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1793) This so often happens!
[29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1795) If one is willing to do a
thing he is afraid to do,
[29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1798) he does not have to.
[30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1800) It is the law of non-resistance,
[30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1803) which is so little understood.
[30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1805) Someone has said that courage
[30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1807) contains genius and magic.
[30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1810) Face a situation fearlessly
[30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1812) and there is no situation to face,
[30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1814) it falls away of its own weight.
[30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1817) The explanation is, that fear attracted
[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1820) the ladder on the woman&#39;s pathway
[30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1822) and fearlessness removed it.
[30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1825) Thus, the invisible
forces are ever working
[30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1828) for man who is always
pulling the strings himself,
[30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1832) though he does not know it.
[30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1834) Owing to the vibratory power of words,
[30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1836) whatever man voices, he begins to attract.
[30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1840) People who continually speak of disease,
[30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1842) invariably attract it.
[30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1844) After man knows the truth,
[30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1846) he cannot be too careful of his words.
[30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1849) For example, I have a friend
[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1851) who often says on the phone,
[30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1854) &#39;Do come to see me
[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1855) and have a fine old-fashioned chat.&#39;
[30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1857) This old-fashioned chat means an hour
[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1860) of about 500 to 1,000 destructive words,
[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1864) the principal topics being loss,
[31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1866) lack, failure and sickness.
[31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1869) I reply, &#39;No, I thank you,
[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1871) I&#39;ve had enough old-fashioned
chats in my life,
[31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1875) they are too expensive,
[31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1876) but I will be glad to
have a new-fashioned chat
[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1879) and talk about what we want,
[31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1881) not what we don&#39;t want.&#39;
[31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1883) There is an old saying
[31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1884) that man only dares use his words
[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1886) for three purposes;
[31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1888) to heal, bless or prosper.
[31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1891) What man says of others,
will be said of him
[31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1894) and what he wishes for another,
[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1895) he is wishing for himself.
[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1898) Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.
[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1901) If a man wishes someone bad luck,
[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1904) he is sure to attract bad luck himself.
[31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1906) If he wishes to aid someone to success,
[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1909) he is wishing and aiding
himself to success.
[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1913) The body may be renewed and transformed
[31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1915) through the spoken word and clear vision
[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1918) and disease be completely wiped out
[32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1920) of the consciousness.
[32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1922) The metaphysician knows that all disease
[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1924) has a mental correspondence
[32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1926) and in order to heal the body,
[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1928) one must first heal the soul.
[32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1931) The soul is the subconscious mind
[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1933) and it must be saved from wrong thinking.
[32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1937) In the 23rd Psalm, we read,
[32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1939) &#39;He restoreth my soul.&#39;
[32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1942) This means that the
subconscious mind or soul,
[32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1945) must be restored with the right ideas
[32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1947) and the mystical marriage
[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1949) is the marriage of the soul and the spirit
[32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1952) or the subconscious and
super-conscious mind.
[32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1955) They must be one.
[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1956) When the sub-conscious is flooded
[32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1958) with the perfect ideas
of the super-conscious,
[32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1961) God and man are one.
[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1962) &#39;I and the Father are one.&#39;
[32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1966) That is, he is one with the realm
[32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1968) of perfect ideas,
[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1969) he is the man made in God&#39;s likeness
[32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1972) and image, imagination
[32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1974) and is given power and dominion
[32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1976) over all created things;
[32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1978) his mind, body and affairs.
[33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1982) It is safe to say that all
sickness and unhappiness
[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1984) come from the violation
of the law of love.
[33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1988) A new commandment I give unto you,
[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1990) &#39;Love one another,&#39;
[33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1992) and in the game of life,
[33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1993) love or goodwill takes every trick.
[33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=1997) For example, a woman I know,
[33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2000) had for years an appearance
of a terrible skin disease.
[33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2003) The doctors told her it was incurable
[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2006) and she was in despair.
[33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2008) She was on the stage and
she feared she would soon
[33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2010) have to give up her profession
[33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2012) and she had no other means of support.
[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2015) She, however, procured a good engagement
[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2017) and on the opening
night, made a great hit.
[33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2021) She received flattering
notices from the critics
[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2023) and was joyful and elated.
[33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2026) The next day she received
a notice of dismissal.
[33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2030) A man in the cast had been
jealous of her success
[33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2033) and had caused her to be sent away.
[33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2035) She felt hatred and resentment
[33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2037) taking complete possession of her
[33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2039) and she cried out,
[34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2040) &#39;Oh God, don&#39;t let me hate that man.&#39;
[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2043) That night she worked
for hours in the silence.
[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2047) She said, &#39;I soon came
into a very deep silence.
[34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2051) I seemed to be at peace with myself,
[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2054) with the man and with the whole world.
[34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2057) I continued this for two following nights
[34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2059) and on the third day,
[34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2061) I found I was healed completely
[34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2063) of the skin disease.&#39;
[34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2065) In asking for love or good will,
[34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2067) she had fulfilled the law,
[34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2069) &#39;For love is the fulfilling of the law&#39;
[34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2072) and the disease,
[34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2073) which came from subconscious resentment
[34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2075) was wiped out.
[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2077) Continual criticism produces rheumatism,
[34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2080) as critical, inharmonious thoughts
[34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2082) cause unnatural deposits in the blood,
[34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2085) which settle in the joints.
[34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2087) False growths are caused
by jealousy, hatred,
[34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2091) unforgiveness, fear, et cetera.
[34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2094) Every disease is caused
by a mind not at ease.
[34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2098) I said once in my class,
[34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2099) &#39;There is no use asking anyone,
[35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2101) what&#39;s the matter with you?&#39;
[35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2103) We might just as well say,
[35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2104) who&#39;s the matter with you?&#39;
[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2106) Unforgiveness is the most
prolific cause of disease.
[35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2110) It will harden arteries or liver
[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2112) and affect the eye-sight.
[35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2114) In its train are endless ills.
[35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2117) I called on a woman one day
[35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2119) who said she was ill
[35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2120) from having eaten a poisoned oyster.
[35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2123) I replied, &#39;Oh, no, the
oyster was harmless,
[35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2126) you poisoned the oyster.
[35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2128) What&#39;s the matter with you?&#39;
[35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2129) She answered, &#39;Oh about 19 people.&#39;
[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2132) She had quarreled with 19 people
[35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2134) and had become so inharmonious
[35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2136) that she attracted the wrong oyster.
[35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2139) Any inharmony on the external,
[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2141) indicates there is mental inharmony.
[35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2144) As the within, so the without.
[35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2147) Man&#39;s only enemies are within himself.
[35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2150) And a man&#39;s foes shall be they
[35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2152) of his own household.
[35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2155) Personality is one of the
last enemies to be overcome,
[35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2159) as this planet is taking
its initiation in love.
[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2163) It was Christ&#39;s message,
[36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2164) &#39;Peace on earth, good will towards man.&#39;
[36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2167) The enlightened man, therefore,
[36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2169) endeavors to perfect
himself upon his neighbor.
[36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2173) His work is with himself,
[36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2175) to send out goodwill and
blessings to every man.
[36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2178) And the marvelous thing is,
[36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2180) that if one blesses a man,
[36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2181) he has no power to harm him.
[36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2184) For example, a man came to me asking
[36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2187) to treat for success in business.
[36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2189) He was selling machinery
[36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2191) and a rival appeared on the scene
[36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2193) with what he proclaimed,
was a better machine
[36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2195) and my friend feared defeat.
[36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2198) I said, &#39;First of all,
we must wipe out all fear
[36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2202) and know that God protects your interests
[36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2204) and that the divine idea
[36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2205) must come out of the situation.
[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2208) That is, the right machine will be sold,
[36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2211) by the right man, to the right man.&#39;
[36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2213) And I added, &#39;Don&#39;t hold
one critical thought
[36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2216) towards that man.
[36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2217) Bless him all day
[36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2219) and be willing not to sell your machine
[37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2221) if it isn&#39;t the divine idea.&#39;
[37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2224) So, he went to the meeting,
[37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2225) fearless and nonresistant
[37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2227) and blessing the other man.
[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2229) He said the outcome was very remarkable.
[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2233) The other man&#39;s machine refused to work
[37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2235) and he sold his without
the slightest difficulty.
[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2239) But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2243) bless them that curse you,
[37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2245) do good to them that hate you
[37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2247) and pray for them which spitefully use you
[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2250) and persecute you.
[37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2252) Goodwill produces a
great aura of protection
[37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2255) about the one who sends it
[37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2257) and no weapon that is formed
against him shall prosper.
[37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2261) In other words, love and goodwill
[37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2265) destroy the enemies within one&#39;s self,
[37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2267) therefore, one has no
enemies on the external!
[37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2272) There is peace on earth for him
[37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2274) who sends goodwill to man!&quot;
[37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2277) Chapter four, &quot;The Law of Non-resistance&quot;.
[38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2282) &quot;Resist not evil.
[38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2284) Be not overcome of evil,
[38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2286) but overcome evil with good.
[38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2289) Nothing on earth can resist
[38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2291) an absolutely non-resistant person.
[38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2294) The Chinese say that water
[38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2295) is the most powerful element,
[38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2298) because it is perfectly non-resistant.
[38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2300) It can wear away a rock
and sweep all before it.
[38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2305) Jesus Christ said, &#39;Resist not evil,&#39;
[38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2308) for He knew in reality, there is no evil,
[38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2311) therefore nothing to resist.
[38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2313) Evil has come of man&#39;s vain imagination
[38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2316) or a belief in two powers, good and evil.
[38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2320) There is an old legend that Adam and Eve
[38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2322) ate of maya the tree of illusion
[38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2325) and saw two powers
instead of one power, God.
[38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2329) Therefore, evil is a false law
[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2332) man has made for himself through psychoma
[38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2335) or soul sleep.
[38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2336) Soul sleep means that man&#39;s soul
[38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2339) has been hypnotized by the race belief
[39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2341) of sin, sickness and death, et cetera,
[39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2345) which is carnal or mortal thought
[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2347) and his affairs have
out-pictured his illusions.
[39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2351) We have read in a preceding chapter,
[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2353) that man&#39;s soul is his subconscious mind
[39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2356) and whatever he feels deeply, good or bad,
[39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2358) is outpictured by that faithful servant.
[39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2361) His body and affairs show forth
[39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2364) what he has been picturing.
[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2366) The sick man has pictured sickness,
[39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2368) the poor man, poverty,
[39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2370) the rich man, wealth.
[39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2372) People often say,
[39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2374) &#39;why does a little child attract illness,
[39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2376) when it is too young even
to know what it means?&#39;
[39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2379) I answer that children are sensitive
[39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2382) and receptive to the
thoughts of others about them
[39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2385) and often outpicture the
fears of their parents.
[39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2388) I heard a metaphysician once say,
[39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2390) &#39;If you do not run your
subconscious mind yourself,
[39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2394) someone else will run it for you.&#39;
[39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2396) Mothers often, unconsciously,
[39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2399) attract illness and
disaster to their children
[40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2402) by continually holding
them in thoughts of fear
[40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2404) and watching for symptoms.
[40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2407) For example, a friend asked a woman
[40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2409) if her little girl had had the measles.
[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2412) She replied promptly, &#39;Not yet!&#39;
[40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2414) This implied that she
was expecting the illness
[40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2417) and therefore, preparing the way
[40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2419) for what she did not want
for herself and child.
[40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2422) However, the man who is centered
[40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2425) and established in right thinking,
[40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2427) the man who sends out only
goodwill to his fellow-man
[40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2431) and who is without fear,
[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2432) cannot be touched or influenced
[40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2435) by the negative thoughts of others.
[40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2437) In fact, he could then
receive only good thoughts,
[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2440) as he himself, sends
forth only good thoughts.
[40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2444) Resistance is hell,
[40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2446) for it places man in a state of torment.
[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2450) A metaphysician once gave
me a wonderful recipe
[40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2453) for taking every trick
in the game of life,
[40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2456) it is the acme of non-resistance.
[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2459) He gave it in this way,
[41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2461) &#39;At one time in my life,
I baptized children
[41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2464) and of course, they had many names.
[41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2467) Now I no longer baptize children,
[41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2469) but I baptize events,
[41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2470) but I give every event the same name.
[41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2474) If I have a failure, I baptize it success,
[41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2477) in the name of the Father and of the Son
[41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2479) and of the Holy Ghost!&#39;
[41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2481) In this, we see the great
law of transmutation
[41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2485) founded on non-resistance.
[41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2487) Through his spoken word,
[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2489) every failure was transmuted into success.
[41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2493) For example, a woman who required money
[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2495) and who knew the spiritual law of opulence
[41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2498) was thrown continually in a business-way,
[41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2501) with a man who made her feel very poor.
[41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2504) He talked lack and limitation
[41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2507) and she commenced to catch
his poverty thoughts,
[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2509) so she disliked him
[41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2511) and blamed him for her failure.
[41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2513) She knew in order to
demonstrate her supply,
[41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2516) she must first feel that she had received.
[41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2519) A feeling of opulence
[42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2520) must precede its manifestation.
[42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2523) It dawned upon her, one day,
[42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2525) that she was resisting the situation
[42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2527) and seeing two powers instead of one.
[42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2530) So, she blessed the man
[42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2531) and baptized the situation, success!
[42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2534) She affirmed, &#39;As there
is only one power, God,
[42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2538) this man is here for my
good and my prosperity,&#39;
[42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2542) just what he did not seem to be there for.
[42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2545) Soon after that she met, through this man,
[42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2547) a woman who gave her
for a service rendered,
[42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2550) several thousand dollars
[42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2552) and the man moved to a distant city
[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2554) and faded harmoniously from her life.
[42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2557) Make the statement, &#39;Every
man is a golden link
[42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2561) in the chain of my good,&#39;
[42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2562) for all men are God in manifestation,
[42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2566) awaiting the opportunity
given by man, himself,
[42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2569) to serve the divine plan of his life.
[42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2573) Bless your enemy and you
rob him of his ammunition.
[42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2576) His arrows will be
transmuted into blessings.
[43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2580) This law is true of nations
[43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2582) as well as individuals.
[43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2584) Bless a nation, send love
[43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2586) and goodwill to every inhabitant
[43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2588) and it is robbed of its power to harm.
[43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2591) Man can only get the right
idea of non-resistance
[43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2594) through spiritual understanding.
[43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2597) My students have often said,
[43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2599) &#39;I don&#39;t wanna be a door-mat.&#39;
[43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2601) I reply, &#39;When you use
non-resistance with wisdom,
[43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2605) no one will ever be
able to walk over you.&#39;
[43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2608) Another example, one day
I was impatiently awaiting
[43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2612) an important telephone call.
[43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2614) I resisted every call that came in
[43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2616) and made no out-going calls myself,
[43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2619) reasoning that it might interfere
[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2620) with the one I was awaiting.
[43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2623) Instead of saying, &#39;Divine
ideas never conflict,
[43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2626) the call will come at the right time,&#39;
[43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2628) leaving it to infinite
intelligence to arrange,
[43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2631) I commenced to manage things myself.
[43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2634) I made the battle mine, not God&#39;s
[43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2637) and remained tense and anxious.
[43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2639) The bell did not ring for about an hour
[44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2642) and I glanced at the phone
[44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2644) and found the receiver had been off
[44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2646) that length of time
[44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2647) and the phone was disconnected.
[44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2649) My anxiety, fear and
belief in interference,
[44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2653) had brought on a total
eclipse of the telephone.
[44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2656) Realizing what I had done,
[44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2658) I commenced blessing
the situation at once.
[44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2661) I baptized it, success and affirmed,
[44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2664) &#39;I cannot lose any call that belongs to me
[44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2667) by divine right.
[44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2668) I am under grace and not under law.&#39;
[44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2672) A friend rushed out to
the nearest telephone,
[44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2674) to notify the company to reconnect.
[44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2677) She entered a crowded grocery,
[44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2679) but the proprietor left his customers
[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2681) and attended to the call himself.
[44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2683) My phone was connected at once
[44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2686) and two minutes later,
[44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2687) I received a very important call
[44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2690) and about an hour afterward,
[44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2691) the one I had been awaiting.
[44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2694) One&#39;s ships come in over a calm sea.
[44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2698) So long as man resists a situation,
[45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2700) he will have it with him.
[45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2702) If he runs away from it,
[45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2703) it will run after him.
[45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2706) For example, I repeated
this to a woman one day
[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2709) and she replied, &#39;How true that is!
[45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2712) I was unhappy at home,
I disliked my mother,
[45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2715) who was critical and domineering,
[45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2717) so I ran away and was married,
[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2720) but I married my mother,
[45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2722) for my husband was exactly like my mother
[45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2724) and I had the same
situation to face again.&#39;
[45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2728) Agree with thine adversary quickly.
[45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2731) That means, agree that the
adverse situation is good,
[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2734) be undisturbed by it
[45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2736) and it falls away of its own weight.
[45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2738) None of these things move me,
[45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2740) is a wonderful affirmation.
[45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2743) The inharmonious situation comes
[45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2745) from some inharmony within man himself.
[45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2748) When there is in him no emotional response
[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2751) to an inharmonious situation,
[45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2753) it fades away forever from his pathway.
[45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2756) So, we see man&#39;s work
is ever with himself.
[46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2760) People have said to me, &#39;Give treatments
[46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2763) to change my husband or my brother.&#39;
[46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2765) I reply, &#39;No, I will give
treatments to change you.
[46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2769) When you change,
[46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2770) your husband and your
brother will change.&#39;
[46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2774) One of my students was
in the habit of lying.
[46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2776) I told her it was a failure
method and if she lied,
[46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2780) she would be lied to.
[46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2782) She replied, &#39;I don&#39;t care,
[46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2784) I can&#39;t possibly get along without lying.&#39;
[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2787) One day she was speaking
on the phone to a man
[46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2789) with whom she was very much in love.
[46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2792) She turned to me and said,
[46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2793) &#39;I don&#39;t trust him, I
know he&#39;s lying to me.&#39;
[46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2796) I replied, &#39;Well, you lie yourself,
[46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2799) so someone has to lie to you
[46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2801) and you will be sure it will be just
[46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2803) the person you want the truth from.&#39;
[46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2805) Sometime after that, I
saw her and she said,
[46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2809) &#39;I&#39;m cured of lying.&#39;
[46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2810) I questioned, &#39;What cured you?&#39;
[46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2813) She replied, &#39;I have
been living with a woman
[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2816) who lied worse than I did.&#39;
[46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2818) One is often cured of his faults
[47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2821) by seeing them in others.
[47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2823) Life is a mirror
[47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2824) and we find only ourselves reflected
[47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2827) in our associates.
[47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2828) Living in the past is a failure method
[47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2831) and a violation of spiritual law.
[47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2834) Jesus Christ said, &#39;Behold,
now is the accepted time.
[47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2838) Now is the day of salvation.&#39;
[47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2841) Lot&#39;s wife looked back
[47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2842) and was turned into a pillar of salt.
[47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2845) The robbers of time are
the past and the future.
[47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2849) Man should bless the past and forget it
[47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2851) if it keeps him in bondage
[47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2853) and bless the future,
[47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2854) knowing it has in store
for him endless joys,
[47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2857) but live fully in the now.
[47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2860) For example, a woman came to me,
[47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2862) complaining that she had no money
[47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2864) with which to buy Christmas gifts.
[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2866) She said, &#39;Last year was so different,
[47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2868) I had plenty of money
and gave lovely presents
[47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2871) and this year I have scarcely a cent.&#39;
[47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2874) I replied, &#39;You will
never demonstrate money
[47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2877) while you are pathetic
and live in the past.
[48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2880) Live fully in the now
[48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2881) and get ready to give Christmas presents.
[48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2884) Dig your ditches and the money will come.&#39;
[48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2886) She exclaimed, &#39;I know what to do!
[48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2888) I will buy some tinsel twine,
[48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2890) Christmas seals and wrapping paper.&#39;
[48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2892) I replied, &#39;Do that and
the presents will come
[48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2895) and stick themselves to
the Christmas seals.&#39;
[48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2898) This too, was showing
financial fearlessness
[48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2901) and faith in God, as
the reasoning mind said,
[48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2904) &#39;Keep every cent you have,
[48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2906) as you are not sure
you will get any more.&#39;
[48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2909) She bought the seals, paper and twine
[48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2912) and a few days before Christmas,
[48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2914) received a gift of
several hundred dollars.
[48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2917) Buying the seals and twine
[48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2918) had impressed the
subconscious with expectancy
[48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2921) and opened the way for the manifestation
[48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2924) of the money.
[48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2925) She purchased all the
presents in plenty of time.
[48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2929) Man must live suspended in the moment.
[48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2932) Look well, therefore, to this day!
[48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2935) Such is the salutation of the dawn.
[48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2938) He must be spiritually alert,
[49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2940) ever awaiting his leads,
[49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2942) taking advantage of every opportunity.
[49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2945) One day, I said continually, silently,
[49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2948) &#39;Infinite Spirit, don&#39;t
let me miss a trick&#39;
[49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2952) and something very important
was told to me that evening.
[49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2956) It is most necessary to begin the day
[49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2958) with right words.
[49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2960) Make an affirmation
immediately upon waking.
[49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2963) For example, &#39;Thy will be done this day!
[49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2966) Today is a day of completion,
[49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2969) I give thanks for this perfect day,
[49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2971) miracle shall follow miracle
[49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2973) and wonders shall never cease.&#39;
[49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2976) Make this a habit and one will see wonders
[49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2979) and miracles come into his life.
[49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2981) One morning I picked up a book and read,
[49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2984) &#39;Look with wonder at that
which is before you!&#39;
[49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2988) It seemed to be my message for the day,
[49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2990) so I repeated again and again,
[49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2993) &#39;Look with wonder at that
which is before you.&#39;
[49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=2996) At about noon, a large
sum of money was given me,
[50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3000) which I had been desiring
for a certain purpose.
[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3003) In a following chapter,
I will give affirmations
[50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3006) that I have found most effective.
[50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3008) However, one should
never use an affirmation
[50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3011) unless it is absolutely satisfying
[50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3013) and convincing to his own consciousness
[50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3016) and often an affirmative is changed
[50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3019) to suit different people.
[50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3021) For example, the following
has brought success to many,
[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3024) &#39;I have a wonderful
work, in a wonderful way,
[50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3029) I give wonderful service,
for wonderful pay!&#39;
[50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3033) I gave the first two lines
to one of my students
[50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3035) and she added the last two.
[50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3038) It made a most powerful statement,
[50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3040) as there should always be perfect payment
[50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3043) for perfect service
[50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3044) and a rhyme sinks easily
into the subconscious.
[50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3048) She went about singing it aloud
[50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3050) and soon did receive wonderful work
[50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3052) in a wonderful way
[50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3054) and gave wonderful
service for wonderful pay.
[50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3058) Another student, a business man, took it
[51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3060) and changed the word work to business.
[51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3063) He repeated, &#39;I have a wonderful business,
[51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3067) in a wonderful way
[51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3068) and I give wonderful
service for wonderful pay.&#39;
[51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3072) That afternoon he made $41,000 deal,
[51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3076) though there had been no activity
[51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3078) in his affairs for months.
[51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3080) Every affirmation must be carefully worded
[51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3083) and completely cover the ground.
[51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3086) For example, I knew a
woman, who was in great need
[51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3090) and made a demand for work.
[51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3092) She received a great deal of work,
[51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3094) but was never paid anything.
[51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3096) She now knows to add,
[51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3098) &#39;Wonderful service for wonderful pay.&#39;
[51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3102) It is man&#39;s divine right to have plenty!
[51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3105) More than enough.
[51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3107) His barns should be full
[51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3109) and his cup should flow over!
[51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3111) This is God&#39;s idea for man
[51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3114) and when man breaks down
the barriers of lack
[51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3117) in his own consciousness,
[51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3118) the golden age will be his
[52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3121) and every righteous desire
[52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3123) of his heart fulfilled!&quot;
[52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3126) Chapter five, &quot;The Law of Karma
[52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3128) and The Law of Forgiveness&quot;.
[52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3131) &quot;Man receives only that which he gives.
[52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3135) The game of life is a game of boomerangs.
[52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3138) Man&#39;s thoughts, deeds and words,
[52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3140) return to him sooner or later
[52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3142) with astounding accuracy.
[52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3145) This is the law of karma,
[52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3146) which is Sanskrit for comeback.
[52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3148) Whatsoever a man soweth,
[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3150) that shall he also reap.
[52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3153) For example, a friend told
me this story of herself
[52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3156) illustrating the law.
[52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3158) She said, &#39;I make all my karma on my aunt,
[52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3161) whatever I say to her,
some one says to me.
[52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3165) I am often irritable at home and one day,
[52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3168) said to my aunt, who was
talking to me during dinner.
[52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3171) No more talk, I wish to eat in peace.&#39;
[52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3174) The following day, I was
lunching with a woman
[52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3177) with whom I wished to
make a great impression,
[52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3179) I was talking animatedly, when she said,
[53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3182) &#39;No more talk, I wish to eat in peace!&#39;
[53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3186) My friend is high in consciousness,
[53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3188) so her karma returns much more quickly
[53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3191) than to one on the mental plane.
[53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3193) The more man knows, the
more he is responsible for
[53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3197) and a person with a
knowledge of spiritual law,
[53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3200) which he does not practice,
[53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3201) suffers greatly, in consequence.
[53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3204) The fear of the Lord, law,
[53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3206) is the beginning of wisdom.
[53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3208) If we read the word Lord, law,
[53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3210) it will make many passages
in the Bible much clearer.
[53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3214) &#39;Vengeance is mine, I will repay,&#39;
[53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3217) saith the Lord, law.
[53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3219) It is the law which
takes vengeance, not God.
[53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3222) God sees man perfect,
[53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3224) created in his own image, imagination
[53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3227) and given power and dominion.
[53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3230) This is the perfect idea of man,
[53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3232) registered in divine mind,
[53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3234) awaiting man&#39;s recognition,
[53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3236) for man can only be what
he sees himself to be
[53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3239) and only attain what he
sees himself attaining.
[54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3243) &#39;Nothing ever happens
without an on-looker,&#39;
[54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3246) is an ancient saying.
[54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3248) Man sees first his failure or success,
[54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3251) his joy or sorrow,
[54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3252) before it swings into visibility
[54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3254) from the scenes set in
his own imagination.
[54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3257) We have observed this
[54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3259) in the mother picturing
disease for her child
[54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3261) or a woman seeing success for her husband.
[54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3264) Jesus Christ said, &#39;And
ye shall know the truth
[54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3268) and the truth shall make you free.&#39;
[54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3271) So, we see freedom from
all unhappy conditions,
[54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3274) comes through knowledge,
[54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3276) a knowledge of spiritual law.
[54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3279) Obedience precedes authority
[54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3281) and the law obeys man
when he obeys the law.
[54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3284) The law of electricity must be obeyed
[54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3286) before it becomes man&#39;s servant.
[54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3289) When handled ignorantly,
[54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3291) it becomes man&#39;s deadly foe.
[54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3293) So with the laws of mind!
[54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3296) For example, a woman with
a strong personal will
[54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3299) wished she owned a house
[55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3301) which belonged to an acquaintance
[55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3303) and she often made mental pictures
[55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3304) of herself living in the house.
[55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3307) In the course of time,
[55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3308) the man died and she moved into the house.
[55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3311) Several years afterwards,
[55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3313) coming into the knowledge
of spiritual law,
[55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3316) she said to me,
[55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3316) &#39;Do you think I had anything to do
[55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3318) with that man&#39;s death?&#39;
[55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3320) I replied, &#39;Yes, your
desire was so strong,
[55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3324) everything made way for it,
[55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3326) but you paid your karmic debt.
[55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3328) Your husband, whom you loved devotedly,
[55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3330) died soon after
[55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3332) and the house was a white elephant
[55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3333) on your hands for years.&#39;
[55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3336) The original owner, however,
[55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3337) could not have been
affected by her thoughts
[55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3339) had he been positive in
the truth, nor her husband,
[55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3343) but they were both under karmic law.
[55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3345) The woman should have said,
[55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3347) feeling the great desire for the house,
[55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3349) &#39;Infinite intelligence,
give me the right house,
[55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3352) equally as charming as this,
[55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3354) the house which is mine by divine right.&#39;
[55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3358) The divine selection
[55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3359) would have given perfect satisfaction
[56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3361) and brought good to all.
[56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3363) The divine pattern is
the only safe pattern
[56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3366) to work by.
[56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3367) Desire is a tremendous force
[56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3370) and must be directed in the right channel
[56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3373) or chaos ensues.
[56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3375) In demonstrating, the most important step
[56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3377) is the first step to ask a right.
[56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3380) Man should always demand
only that which is his
[56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3383) by divine right.
[56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3385) To go back to the illustration,
[56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3387) had the woman taken this attitude,
[56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3389) &#39;If this house I desire is mine,
[56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3391) I cannot lose it,
[56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3393) if it is not, give me its equivalent,&#39;
[56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3396) the man might have decided
to move out, harmoniously,
[56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3399) had it been the divine selection for her
[56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3401) or another house would
have been substituted.
[56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3404) Anything forced into manifestation
[56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3406) through personal will,
[56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3407) is always ill-got and
has ever bad success.
[56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3412) Man is admonished, &#39;My
will be done not thine
[56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3415) and the curious thing is,
[56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3417) man always gets just what he desires
[56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3419) when he does relinquish personal will,
[57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3421) thereby enabling infinite intelligence
[57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3424) to work through him.&#39;
[57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3425) Stand ye still
[57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3427) and see the salvation of the Lord, law.
[57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3430) For example, a woman came
to me in great distress.
[57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3434) Her daughter had determined
[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3435) to take a very hazardous trip
[57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3437) and the mother was filled with fear.
[57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3440) She said she had used every argument,
[57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3442) had pointed out the
dangers to be encountered
[57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3444) and forbidden her to go,
[57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3446) but the daughter became more
[57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3448) and more rebellious and determined.
[57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3450) I said to the mother,
[57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3451) &#39;You are forcing your personal will
[57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3453) upon your daughter,
[57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3455) which you have no right to do
[57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3456) and your fear of the trip
is only attracting it,
[57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3460) for man attracts what he fears.&#39;
[57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3462) I added, &#39;Let go and take
your mental hands off,
[57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3466) put it in God&#39;s hands
and use this statement,
[57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3470) I put this situation in the hands
[57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3472) of infinite love and wisdom,
[57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3474) if this trip is the divine plan,
[57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3476) I bless it and no longer resist,
[57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3479) but if it is not divinely planned,
[58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3481) I give thanks that it is now
dissolved and dissipated.&#39;
[58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3486) A day or two after that,
[58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3487) her daughter said to her,
[58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3489) &#39;Mother, I have given up the trip&#39;
[58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3491) and the situation returned
to its native nothingness.
[58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3495) It is learning to stand still,
[58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3497) which seems so difficult for man.
[58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3499) I will deal more fully with this law
[58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3501) in the chapter on non-resistance.
[58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3504) I will give another example
of sowing and reaping,
[58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3506) which came in the most curious way.
[58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3509) A woman came to me saying,
[58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3511) she had received a counterfeit $20 bill
[58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3513) given to her at the bank.
[58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3515) She was much disturbed for, she said,
[58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3517) &#39;The people at the bank
[58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3518) will never acknowledge their mistake.&#39;
[58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3521) I replied, &#39;Let us analyze the situation
[58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3524) and find out why you attracted it.&#39;
[58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3526) She thought a few moments and exclaimed,
[58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3528) &#39;I know it, I sent a friend
a lot of stage money,
[58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3532) just for a joke.&#39;
[58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3534) So, the law had sent her some stage money
[58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3536) for it doesn&#39;t know anything about jokes.
[58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3539) I said, &#39;Now we will call
on the law of forgiveness
[59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3543) and neutralize the situation.&#39;
[59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3545) Christianity is founded
upon the law of forgiveness.
[59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3549) Christ has redeemed us
[59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3550) from the curse of the karmic law
[59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3552) and the Christ within
each man is his Redeemer
[59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3555) and salvation from all
inharmonious conditions.
[59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3559) So, I said, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3561) we call on the law of forgiveness
[59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3563) and give thanks that she is under grace
[59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3565) and not under law and
cannot lose this $20,
[59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3569) which is hers by divine right.&#39;
[59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3572) &#39;Now,&#39; I said, &#39;go back to the bank
[59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3573) and tell them fearlessly
[59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3575) that it was given you, there by mistake.&#39;
[59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3577) She obeyed and to her surprise,
[59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3580) they apologized and gave her another bill,
[59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3582) treating her most courteously.
[59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3585) So, knowledge of the law gives man power
[59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3587) to rub out his mistakes.
[59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3590) Man cannot force the external
[59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3591) to be what he is not.
[59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3594) If he desires riches,
[59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3595) he must be rich first in consciousness.
[59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3598) For example, a woman came to me
[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3601) asking treatment for prosperity.
[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3603) She did not take much interest
[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3605) in her household affairs
[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3606) and her home was in great disorder.
[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3608) I said to her, &#39;If you wish to be rich,
[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3611) you must be orderly.
[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3612) All men with great wealth are orderly
[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3615) and order is heaven&#39;s first law.&#39;
[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3617) I added, &#39;You will never become rich
[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3620) with a burnt match in the pin-cushion.&#39;
[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3623) She had a good sense of humor
[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3624) and commenced immediately,
[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3625) putting her house in order.
[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3627) She rearranged furniture,
[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3629) straightened out bureau
drawers, cleaned rugs
[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3632) and soon made a big
financial demonstration,
[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3635) a gift from a relative.
[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3637) The woman, herself, became made over
[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3640) and keeps herself keyed-up financially
[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3642) by being ever watchful of the external
[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3645) and expecting prosperity,
[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3647) knowing God is her supply.
[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3650) Many people are in ignorance
[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3651) of the fact that gifts
and things are investments
[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3655) and that hoarding and saving
[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3656) invariably lead to loss.
[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3659) There is that scattereth
and yet increaseth
[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3662) and there is that withholdeth
more than is meet,
[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3665) but it tendeth to poverty.
[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3668) For example, I knew a man who wanted
[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3670) to buy a fur-lined overcoat.
[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3673) He and his wife went to various shops,
[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3675) but there was none he wanted.
[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3677) He said they were all too cheap-looking.
[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3679) At last, he was shown one,
[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3681) the salesman said was valued at $1,000,
[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3684) but which the manager
would sell him for $500
[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3687) as it was late in the season.
[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3690) His financial possessions
amounted to about $700.
[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3694) The reasoning mind would have said,
[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3696) &#39;You can&#39;t afford to spend
[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3698) nearly all you have on a coat,&#39;
[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3700) but he was very intuitive
and never reasoned.
[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3703) He turned to his wife and said,
[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3705) &#39;If I get this coat, I&#39;ll
make a ton of money!&#39;
[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3708) So his wife consented weakly.
[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3711) About a month later,
[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3712) he received $10,000 commission.
[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3715) The coat made him feel so rich,
[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3718) it linked him with success and prosperity.
[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3721) Without the coat,
[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3722) he would not have received the commission.
[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3724) It was an investment
paying large dividends.
[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3727) If man ignores these
leadings to spend or to give,
[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3731) the same amount of money will go
[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3733) in an uninteresting or unhappy way.
[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3736) For example, a woman told
me on Thanksgiving Day,
[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3740) she informed her family
[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3741) that they could not afford
a Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3744) She had the money, but decided to save it.
[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3747) A few days later, someone entered her room
[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3749) and took from the bureau drawer
[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3751) the exact amount the
dinner would have cost.
[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3754) The law always stands back of the man
[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3757) who spends fearlessly, with wisdom.
[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3759) For example, one of my
students was shopping
[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3762) with her little nephew.
[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3764) The child clamored for a toy,
[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3765) which she told him she
could not afford to buy.
[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3768) She realized suddenly
that she was seeking lack
[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3771) and not recognizing God as her supply!
[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3774) So, she bought the toy
and on her way home,
[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3777) picked up in the street,
[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3778) the exact amount of money
she had paid for it.
[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3782) Man&#39;s supply is inexhaustible
[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3784) and unfailing when fully trusted,
[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3787) but faith or trust must
precede the demonstration.
[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3791) According to your faith be it unto you.
[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3794) Faith is the substance
of things hoped for,
[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3797) the evidence of things not seen
[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3799) for faith holds the vision steady
[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3802) and the adverse pictures
are dissolved and dissipated
[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3805) and in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.
[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3810) Jesus Christ brought the
good news, the gospel
[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3812) that there was a higher
law than the law of karma
[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3816) and that that law
transcends the law of karma.
[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3819) It is the law of grace or forgiveness.
[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3822) It is the law which frees man
[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3824) from the law of cause and effect,
[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3826) the law of consequence.
[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3828) Under grace and not under law.
[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3832) We are told that on this plane,
[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3834) man reaps where he has not sown,
[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3836) the gifts of God are
simply poured out upon him.
[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3839) All that the Kingdom affords is his.
[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3843) This continued state
of bliss awaits the man
[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3845) who has overcome the
race or world thought.
[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3849) In the world thought there is tribulation,
[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3851) but Jesus Christ said,
[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3853) &#39;Be of good cheer, I
have overcome the world.&#39;
[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3857) The world thought is that of sin,
[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3860) sickness and death.
[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3862) He saw their absolute unreality
[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3864) and said sickness and
sorrow shall pass away
[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3867) and death itself, the
last enemy, be overcome.
[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3871) We know now, from a scientific standpoint,
[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3874) that death could be overcome by stamping
[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3876) the subconscious mind with the conviction
[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3878) of eternal youth and eternal life.
[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3882) The subconscious, being simply
power without direction,
[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3885) carries out orders without questioning.
[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3888) Working under the direction
of the super-conscious,
[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3891) the Christ or God within man,
[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3893) the resurrection of the
body would be accomplished.
[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3897) Man would no longer throw
off his body in death,
[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3901) it would be transformed
into the &quot;Body Electric,&quot;
[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3904) sung by Walt Whitman,
[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3905) for Christianity is founded
upon the forgiveness
[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3909) of sins and an empty tomb.&quot;
[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3912) Chapter six, &quot;Casting the Burden&quot;.
[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3916) &quot;Impressing the subconscious.
[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3918) When man knows his own powers
[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3920) and the workings of his mind,
[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3922) his great desire is to find an easy
[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3925) and quick way to impress
the subconscious with good,
[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3928) for simply an intellectual knowledge
[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3930) of the truth will not bring results.
[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3933) In my own case, I found the easiest way
[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3936) is in casting the burden.
[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3938) A metaphysician once
explained it in this manner.
[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3941) He said, &#39;The only thing
which gives anything
[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3944) weight in nature is the law of gravitation
[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3948) and if a boulder could be
taken high above the planet,
[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3951) there would be no weight in that boulder.&#39;
[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3953) And that is what Jesus
Christ meant when he said,
[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3956) &#39;My yoke is easy and my burden is light.&#39;
[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3960) He had overcome the world vibration
[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3963) and functioned in the
fourth dimensional realm,
[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3965) where there is only perfection,
[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3967) completion, life and joy.
[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3970) He said, &#39;Come to me all ye that labor
[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3973) and are heavy laden and
I will give you rest.
[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3976) Take my yoke upon you,
[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3978) for my yoke is easy and
my burden is light.&#39;
[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3983) We are also told in the 55th Psalm,
[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3985) to cast thy burden upon the Lord.
[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3988) Many passages in the Bible state
[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3990) that the battle is God&#39;s not man&#39;s
[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3993) and that man is always to stand still
[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3995) and see the salvation of the Lord.
[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=3999) This indicates that the
super-conscious mind
[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4001) or Christ within is the department
[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4004) which fights man&#39;s battle
[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4006) and relieves him of burdens.
[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4008) We see, therefore, that man violates law
[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4011) if he carries a burden
[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4013) and a burden is an adverse
thought or condition
[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4016) and this thought or condition
[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4018) has its root in the subconscious.
[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4021) It seems almost impossible
to make any headway
[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4023) directing the subconscious
from the conscious
[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4026) or reasoning mind,
[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4028) as the reasoning mind, the intellect
[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4030) is limited in its conceptions
[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4032) and filled with doubts and fears.
[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4035) How scientific it then is,
[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4037) to cast the burden upon
the super-conscious mind
[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4040) or Christ within where it is made light
[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4043) or dissolved into its native nothingness.
[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4046) For example, a woman in
urgent need of money,
[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4050) made light upon the Christ within,
[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4052) the super-conscious, with the statement,
[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4055) &#39;I cast this burden of
lack on the Christ within
[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4058) and I go free to have plenty!&#39;
[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4061) The belief in lack was her burden
[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4063) and as she cast it upon
the super-conscious
[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4066) with its belief of plenty,
[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4067) an avalanche of supply was the result.
[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4071) We read, &#39;The Christ in
you, the hope of glory.&#39;
[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4076) Another example, one of my students
[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4079) had been given a new piano
[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4081) and there was no room in her studio for it
[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4083) until she had moved out the old one.
[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4086) She was in a state of perplexity.
[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4087) She wanted to keep the old piano,
[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4090) but knew of no place to send it.
[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4092) She became desperate,
[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4093) as the new piano was
to be sent immediately,
[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4096) in fact, was on its way
with no place to put it.
[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4100) She said it came to her to repeat,
[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4101) &#39;I cast this burden on the Christ within
[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4104) and I go free.&#39;
[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4106) A few moments later, her phone rang
[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4109) and a woman friend asked
[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4110) if she might rent her old piano
[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4112) and it was moved out a few minutes
[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4114) before the new one arrived.
[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4117) I knew a woman, whose
burden was resentment.
[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4120) She said, &#39;I cast this
burden of resentment
[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4122) on the Christ within and I go free,
[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4125) to be loving, harmonious and happy.&#39;
[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4128) The almighty super-conscious
[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4130) flooded the subconscious with love
[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4132) and her whole life was changed.
[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4134) For years, resentment had held her
[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4136) in a state of torment
and imprisoned her soul,
[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4139) the subconscious mind.
[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4141) The statement should be
made over and over and over,
[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4144) sometimes for hours at a time,
[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4146) silently or audibly,
[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4148) with quietness but determination.
[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4151) I have often compared it
to winding-up a Victrola.
[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4154) We must wind ourselves
up with spoken words.
[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4158) I have noticed, in casting the burden,
[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4160) after a little while,
one seems to see clearly.
[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4163) It is impossible to have clear vision
[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4166) while in the throes of carnal mind.
[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4168) Doubts and fear poison the mind and body
[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4171) and imagination runs riot,
[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4173) attracting disaster and disease.
[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4176) In steadily repeating the affirmation,
[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4178) &#39;I cast this burden on the Christ within
[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4181) and go free,&#39;
[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4182) the vision clears and with
it a feeling of relief
[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4186) and sooner or later,
[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4188) comes the manifestation of good,
[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4190) be it health, happiness or supply.
[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4194) One of my students once
asked me to explain
[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4196) the darkness before the dawn.
[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4198) I referred in a preceding chapter
[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4200) to the fact that often,
before the big demonstration,
[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4204) everything seems to go wrong
[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4206) and deep depression
clouds the consciousness.
[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4209) It means that out of the subconscious
[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4211) are rising the doubts
and fears of the ages.
[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4214) These old derelicts of the subconscious
[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4217) rise to the surface, to be put out.
[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4219) It is then, that man
should clap his cymbals,
[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4223) like Jehoshaphat and give
thanks that he is saved,
[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4226) even though he seems
surrounded by the enemy,
[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4229) the situation of lack or disease.
[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4231) The student continued,
[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4232) &#39;How long must one remain in the dark?&#39;
[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4235) And I replied, &#39;Until
one can see in the dark&#39;
[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4239) and casting the burden enables one
[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4241) to see in the dark.
[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4243) In order to impress the subconscious,
[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4246) active faith is always essential.
[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4249) Faith without works is dead.
[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4251) In these chapters,
[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4252) I have endeavored to bring out this point.
[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4255) Jesus Christ showed active faith
[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4258) when He commanded the multitude
[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4259) to sit down on the ground
[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4261) before he gave thanks for
the loaves and the fishes.
[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4265) I will give another example
[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4266) showing how necessary this step is.
[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4268) In fact, active faith is the bridge
[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4271) over which man passes
to his Promised Land.
[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4275) Through misunderstanding,
a woman had been separated
[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4278) from her husband whom she loved deeply.
[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4280) He refused all offers of reconciliation
[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4283) and would not communicate
with her in any way.
[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4287) Coming into the knowledge
of spiritual law,
[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4290) she denied the appearance of separation.
[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4292) She made this statement,
[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4293) &#39;There is no separation in divine mind,
[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4297) therefore, I cannot be
separated from the love
[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4300) and companionship which
are mine by divine right.&#39;
[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4304) She showed active faith
by arranging a place
[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4306) for him at the table every day,
[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4308) thereby impressing the subconscious
[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4311) with a picture of his return.
[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4313) Over a year passed, but she never wavered
[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4316) and one day he walked in.
[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4320) The subconscious is often
impressed through music.
[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4323) Music has a fourth dimensional quality
[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4326) and releases the soul from imprisonment.
[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4329) It makes wonderful things seem possible
[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4331) and easy of accomplishment.
[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4333) I have a friend who
uses her Victrola daily
[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4336) for this purpose.
[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4337) It puts her in perfect harmony
[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4340) and releases the imagination.
[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4342) Another woman often dances
[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4344) while making her affirmations.
[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4346) The rhythm and harmony of music
[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4348) and motion carry her words forth
[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4350) with tremendous power.
[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4353) The student must remember also,
[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4355) not to despise the day of small things.
[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4358) Invariably, before a demonstration,
[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4361) come signs of land.
[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4363) Before Columbus reached America,
[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4365) he saw birds and twigs
[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4367) which showed him land was near.
[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4369) So it is with a demonstration,
[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4371) but often the student mistakes it
[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4373) for the demonstration
itself and is disappointed.
[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4377) For example, a woman had spoken the word
[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4380) for a set of dishes.
[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4381) Not long afterwards, a
friend gave her a dish
[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4384) which was old and cracked.
[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4386) She came to me and said,
[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4388) &#39;Well, I asked for a set of dishes
[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4390) and all I got was a cracked plate.&#39;
[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4392) I replied, &#39;The plate
was only signs of land.
[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4396) It shows your dishes are coming.
[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4398) Look upon it as birds and seaweed&#39;
[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4401) and not long afterwards the dishes came.
[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4405) Continually making-believe,
[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4407) impresses the subconscious.
[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4409) If one makes believe he is rich
[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4411) and makes believe he is successful,
[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4413) in due time he will reap.
[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4416) Children are always making believe
[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4418) and except ye be converted
[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4420) and become as little children,
[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4422) ye shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4426) For example, I know of a
woman who was very poor,
[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4429) but no one could make her feel poor.
[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4432) She earned a small amount of money
[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4434) from rich friends,
[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4435) who constantly reminded her of her poverty
[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4438) and to be careful and saving.
[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4440) Regardless of their admonitions,
[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4442) she would spend all her earnings on a hat
[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4445) or make someone a gift
[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4446) and be in a rapturous state of mind.
[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4449) Her thoughts were always
centered on beautiful clothes
[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4452) and rings and things, but
without envying others.
[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4456) She lived in the world of the wondrous
[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4458) and only riches seemed real to her.
[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4461) Before long she married a rich man
[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4463) and the rings and things became visible.
[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4466) I do not know whether the man
[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4468) was the divine selection,
[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4469) but opulence had to manifest in her life,
[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4472) as she had imaged only opulence.
[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4476) There is no peace or happiness for man,
[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4478) until he has erased all
fear from the subconscious.
[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4482) Fear is misdirected energy
and must be redirected
[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4486) or traflsmuced into faith.
[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4489) Jesus Christ said, &#39;Why are ye fearful,
[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4492) O ye of little faith?
[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4494) All things are possible
to him that believeth.&#39;
[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4497) I am asked, so often by my students,
[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4500) &#39;How can I get rid of fear?&#39;
[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4502) I reply, &#39;By walking up
[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4504) to the thing you are afraid of.&#39;
[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4507) The lion takes its
fierceness from your fear.
[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4510) Walk up to the lion and he will disappear,
[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4513) run away and he runs after you.
[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4516) I have shown in previous chapters,
[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4518) how the lion of lack disappeared
[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4520) when the individual
spent money fearlessly,
[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4523) showing faith that God was his supply
[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4525) and therefore, unfailing.
[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4528) Many of my students
[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4529) have come out of the bondage of poverty
[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4531) and are now bountifully supplied
[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4533) through losing all fear
of letting money go out.
[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4536) The subconscious is
impressed with the truth
[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4539) that God is the Giver and the Gift,
[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4542) therefore as one is one with the Giver,
[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4544) he is one with the Gift.
[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4546) A splendid statement is,
[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4548) &#39;I now thank God the
Giver for God the Gift.&#39;
[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4553) Man has so long separated himself
[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4555) from his good and his supply
[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4557) through thoughts of separation and lack,
[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4560) that sometimes, it takes
dynamite to dislodge
[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4563) these false ideas from the subconscious
[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4565) and the dynamite is a big situation.
[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4569) We see in the foregoing illustration,
[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4571) how the individual was
freed from his bondage
[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4574) by showing fearlessness.
[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4576) Man should watch himself hourly
[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4578) to detect if his motive for
action is fear or faith.
[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4583) Choose ye this day whom we shall serve,
[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4586) fear or faith.
[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4588) Perhaps one&#39;s fear is of personality.
[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4591) Then do not avoid the people feared.
[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4593) Be willing to meet them cheerfully
[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4595) and they will either prove golden links
[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4598) in the chain of one&#39;s good
[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4599) or disappear harmoniously
from one&#39;s pathway.
[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4603) Perhaps one&#39;s fear is of disease or germs.
[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4606) Then, one should be fearless
[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4608) and undisturbed in a germ-laden situation
[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4611) and he would be immune.
[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4613) One can only contract germs
[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4615) while vibrating at the
same rate as the germ
[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4618) and fear drags men down
to the level of the germ.
[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4621) Of course, the disease laden germ
[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4623) is the product of carnal mind,
[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4625) as all thought must objectify.
[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4628) Germs do not exist in the super-conscious
[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4630) or divine mind,
[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4631) therefore are the product
[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4633) of man&#39;s vain imagination.
[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4636) In the twinkling of an eye,
[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4637) man&#39;s release will come when he realizes
[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4640) there is no power in evil.
[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4643) The material world will fade away
[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4645) and the fourth dimensional world,
[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4647) the world of the wondrous
[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4649) will swing into manifestation.
[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4652) And I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4655) and there shall be no more death,
[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4658) neither sorrow nor crying,
[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4660) neither shall there be any more pain,
[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4663) for the former things are passed away.&quot;
[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4668) Chapter seven, &quot;Love&quot;.
[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4671) &quot;Every man on this planet
[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4673) is taking his initiation in love.
[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4676) A new commandment I give unto you,
[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4678) that ye love one another.
[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4681) Ouspensky states in &quot;Tertium Organum&quot;,
[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4684) that love is a cosmic phenomenon
[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4687) and opens to man the
fourth dimensional world,
[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4690) the world of the wondrous.
[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4692) Real love is selfless and free from fear.
[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4696) It pours itself out upon
the object of its affection
[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4699) without demanding any return.
[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4701) Its joy is in the joy of giving.
[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4704) Love is God in manifestation
[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4707) and the strongest magnetic
force in the universe.
[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4710) Pure, unselfish love
draws to itself its own,
[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4715) it does not need to seek or demand.
[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4718) Scarcely anyone has
the faintest conception
[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4720) of real love.
[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4722) Man is selfish, tyrannical
[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4724) or fearful in his affections,
[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4727) thereby losing the thing he loves.
[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4730) Jealousy is the worst enemy of love,
[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4732) for the imagination runs riot,
[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4735) seeing the loved one attracted to another
[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4737) and invariably these fears objectify
[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4740) if they are not neutralized.
[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4742) For example, a woman came
to me in deep distress.
[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4746) The man she loved had
left her for other women
[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4749) and said he never intended to marry her.
[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4752) She was torn with jealousy and resentment
[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4755) and said she hoped he would suffer
[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4757) as he had made her suffer and added,
[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4759) &#39;How could he leave me
when I loved him so much?&#39;
[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4763) I replied, &#39;You are not loving that man,
[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4766) you are hating him&#39; and added,
[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4768) &#39;You can never receive
what you have never given.
[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4772) Give a perfect love
[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4773) and you will receive a perfect love.
[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4776) Perfect yourself on this man.
[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4778) Give him a perfect, unselfish love,
[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4781) demanding nothing in return,
[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4783) do not criticize or condemn
[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4785) and bless him wherever he is.&#39;
[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4788) She replied, &#39;No, I won&#39;t bless him
[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4790) unless I know where he is!&#39;
[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4792) &#39;Well,&#39; I said, &#39;that is not real love.
[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4796) When you send out real love,
[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4798) real love will return to you,
[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4800) either from this man or his equivalent,
[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4803) for if this man is not
the divine selection,
[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4806) you will not want him.
[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4808) As you are one with God,
[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4809) you are one with the love
[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4811) which belongs to you by divine right.&#39;
[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4814) Several months passed
[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4815) and matters remained about the same,
[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4818) but she was working
conscientiously with herself.
[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4821) I said, &#39;When you are no longer disturbed
[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4823) by his cruelty, he will cease to be cruel,
[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4826) as you are attracting it
through your own emotions.&#39;
[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4830) Then I told her of a brotherhood in India,
[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4832) who never said, &#39;Good
morning&#39; to each other.
[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4835) They used these words,
[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4837) &#39;I salute the divinity in you.&#39;
[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4839) They saluted the divinity in every man
[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4842) and in the wild animals in the jungle
[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4844) and they were never harmed,
[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4845) for they saw only God
in every living thing.
[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4850) I said, &#39;Salute the divinity in this man&#39;
[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4852) and say, &#39;I see your divine self only.
[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4856) I see you as God sees you, perfect,
[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4859) made in His image and likeness.&#39;
[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4862) She found she was becoming more poised
[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4864) and gradually losing her resentment.
[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4867) He was a Captain,
[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4868) and she always called him, &#39;The Cap.&#39;
[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4871) One day, she said, suddenly,
[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4872) &#39;God bless the Cap wherever he is.&#39;
[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4875) I replied, &#39;Now, that is real love
[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4878) and when you have become a complete circle
[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4881) and are no longer
disturbed by the situation,
[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4884) you will have his love or
attract its equivalent.&#39;
[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4888) I was moving at this time
[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4889) and did not have a telephone,
[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4891) so was out of touch with
her for a few weeks,
[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4894) when one morning I
received a letter saying,
[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4896) &#39;We are married.&#39;
[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4898) At the earliest opportunity,
I paid her a call.
[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4902) My first words were, &#39;What happened?&#39;
[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4904) &#39;Oh,&#39; she exclaimed, &#39;a miracle!
[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4907) One day I woke up and
all suffering had ceased.
[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4911) I saw him that evening and
he asked me to marry him.
[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4915) We were married in about a week
[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4917) and I have never seen a more devoted man.&#39;
[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4921) There is an old saying,
&#39;No man is your enemy,
[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4924) no man is your friend,
every man is your teacher.&#39;
[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4929) So one should become impersonal
[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4931) and learn what each man has to teach him
[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4933) and soon he would learn
his lessons and be free.
[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4937) The woman&#39;s lover was
teaching her selfless love,
[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4940) which every man, sooner
or later, must learn.
[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4944) Suffering is not necessary
for man&#39;s development,
[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4948) it is the result of
violation of spiritual law,
[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4951) but few people seem
able to rouse themselves
[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4954) from their soul sleep without it.
[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4957) When people are happy,
[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4958) they usually become selfish,
[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4960) and automatically the law of karma
[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4962) is set in action.
[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4964) Man often suffers loss
through lack of appreciation.
[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4968) I knew a woman who had
a very nice husband,
[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4971) but she said often,
[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4972) &quot;I don&#39;t care anything
about being married,
[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4975) but that is nothing against my husband.
[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4977) I&#39;m simply not interested
in married life.&#39;
[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4980) She had other interests
[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4981) and scarcely remembered she had a husband.
[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4984) She only thought of him when she saw him.
[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4986) One day her husband
told her he was in love
[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4989) with another woman and left.
[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4991) She came to me in distress and resentment.
[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4994) I replied, &#39;It is exactly
what you spoke the word for.
[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4998) You said you didn&#39;t care anything
[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=4999) about being married,
[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5000) so the subconscious worked
to get you unmarried.&#39;
[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5004) She said, &#39;Oh yes, I see.
[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5006) People get what they want
[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5008) and then feel very much hurt.&#39;
[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5010) She soon became in perfect
harmony with the situation
[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5014) and knew they were both
much happier apart.
[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5017) When a woman becomes
indifferent or critical
[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5019) and ceases to be an
inspiration to her husband,
[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5022) he misses the stimulus of
their early relationship
[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5025) and is restless and unhappy.
[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5028) A man came to me dejected,
miserable and poor.
[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5031) His wife was interested
in the science of numbers
[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5035) and had had him read.
[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5036) It seems the report
was not very favorable,
[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5039) for he said, &#39;My wife
says I&#39;ll never amount
[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5042) to anything because I am a two.&#39;
[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5045) I replied, &#39;I don&#39;t care
what your number is,
[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5048) you are a perfect idea in divine mind
[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5051) and we will demand the
success and prosperity
[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5054) which are already planned for you
[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5056) by that infinite intelligence.&#39;
[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5059) Within a few weeks, he
had a very fine position
[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5062) and a year or two later,
[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5064) he achieved a brilliant
success as a writer.
[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5067) No man is a success in business
[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5069) unless he loves his work.
[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5071) The picture the artist
paints for love of his art
[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5074) is his greatest work.
[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5076) The pot-boiler is always
something to live down.
[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5080) No man can attract
money if he despises it.
[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5083) Many people are kept in poverty by saying,
[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5086) &#39;Money means nothing to me
[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5087) and I have a contempt
for people who have it.&#39;
[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5090) This is the reason so
many artists are poor.
[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5093) Their contempt for money
separates them from it.
[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5097) I remember hearing one
artist say of another,
[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5099) &#39;He&#39;s no good as an artist,
[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5101) he has money in the bank.&#39;
[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5103) This attitude of mind, of course,
[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5105) separates man from his supply,
[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5107) he must be in harmony with a thing
[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5109) in order to attract it.
[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5111) Money is God in manifestation,
[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5113) as freedom from want and limitation,
[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5116) but it must be always kept in circulation
[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5119) and put to right uses.
[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5121) Hoarding and saving react
with grim vengeance.
[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5125) This does not mean that
man should not have houses
[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5128) and lots, stocks and bonds,
[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5130) for the barns of the
righteous man shall be full.
[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5134) It means man should not
hoard even the principal,
[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5137) if an occasion arises
when money is necessary.
[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5141) In letting it go out
fearlessly and cheerfully,
[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5144) he opens the way for more to come in,
[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5147) for God is man&#39;s unfailing
and inexhaustible supply.
[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5151) This is the spiritual
attitude towards money
[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5154) and the great bank of the
universal never fails!
[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5158) We see an example of hoarding
[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5160) in the film production of &quot;Greed&quot;.
[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5162) The woman won $5,000 in a lottery,
[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5165) but would not spend it.
[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5167) She hoarded and saved,
[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5169) let her husband suffer and starve
[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5171) and eventually she scrubbed
floors for a living.
[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5175) She loved the money itself
[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5177) and put it above everything
[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5179) and one night she was murdered
[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5181) and the money taken from her.
[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5184) This is an example of where love of money
[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5186) is the root of all evil.
[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5188) Money in itself, is good and beneficial,
[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5191) but used for destructive purposes,
[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5193) hoarded and saved
[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5195) or considered more important than love,
[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5197) brings disease and disaster
[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5199) and the loss of the money itself.
[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5202) Follow the path of love
and all things are added,
[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5206) for God is love and God is supply,
[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5210) follow the path of selfishness and greed
[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5213) and the supply vanishes
[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5214) or man is separated from it.
[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5217) For example, I knew the
case of a very rich woman
[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5220) who hoarded her income.
[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5222) She rarely gave anything away,
[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5224) but bought and bought and
bought things for herself.
[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5228) She was very fond of necklaces
[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5231) and a friend once asked
her how many she possessed.
[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5234) She replied, &#39;67.&#39;
[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5236) She bought them and put them away,
[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5238) carefully wrapped in tissue paper.
[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5240) Had she used the necklaces,
[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5242) it would have been quite legitimate,
[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5244) but she was violating the law of use.
[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5247) Her closets were filled
with clothes she never wore
[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5250) and jewels which never saw the light.
[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5253) The woman&#39;s arms were
gradually becoming paralyzed
[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5256) from holding on to things
[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5257) and eventually, she was
considered incapable
[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5260) of looking after her affairs
[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5262) and her wealth was handed
over to others to manage.
[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5266) So, man, in ignorance of the law,
[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5268) brings about his own destruction.
[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5271) All disease, all unhappiness,
[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5274) come from the violation
of the law of love.
[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5278) Man&#39;s boomerangs of hate,
[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5280) resentment and criticism,
[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5282) come back laden with sickness and sorrow.
[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5285) Love seems almost a lost art,
[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5288) but the man with the
knowledge of spiritual law
[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5290) knows it must be regained, for without it,
[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5293) he has become as sounding brass
[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5296) and tinkling cymbals.
[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5298) For example, I had a
student who came to me,
[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5301) month after month
[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5302) to clean her consciousness of resentment.
[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5305) After a while, she arrived at the point
[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5308) where she resented only one woman,
[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5310) but that one woman kept her busy.
[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5312) Little by little she became
poised and harmonious
[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5316) and one day, all resentment was wiped out.
[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5320) She came in radiant and exclaimed,
[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5322) &#39;You can&#39;t understand how I feel!
[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5325) The woman said something to me
[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5327) and instead of being furious,
[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5328) I was loving and kind
[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5329) and she apologized and was
perfectly lovely to me.
[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5333) No one can understand
[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5334) the marvelous lightness I feel within!&#39;
[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5338) Love and goodwill are
invaluable in business.
[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5341) For example, a woman came to me
[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5344) complaining of her employer.
[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5346) She said she was cold and critical
[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5348) and knew she did not
want her in the position.
[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5351) &#39;Well,&#39; I replied, &#39;salute
the divinity in the woman
[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5354) and send her love.&#39;
[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5356) She said, &#39;I can&#39;t, she&#39;s a marble woman.&#39;
[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5359) I answered, &#39;You remember
the story of the sculptor
[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5361) who asked for a certain piece of marble.
[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5364) He was asked why he
wanted it and he replied,
[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5367) &#39;because there is an angel in the marble&#39;
[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5370) and out of it he produced
a wonderful work of art.&#39;
[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5374) She said, &#39;Very well, I&#39;ll try it.&#39;
[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5377) A week later she came back and said,
[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5378) &#39;I did what you told me to
[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5380) and now the woman is very kind
[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5382) and took me out in her car.&#39;
[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5384) People are sometimes filled with remorse
[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5386) for having done someone an unkindness,
[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5388) perhaps years ago.
[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5390) If the wrong cannot be righted,
[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5392) its effect can be neutralized
[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5394) by doing someone a
kindness in the present.
[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5397) &#39;This one thing I do,
[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5399) forgetting those things which are behind
[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5402) and reaching forth unto those things
[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5404) which are before.&#39;
[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5406) Sorrow, regret and remorse tear down
[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5410) the cells of the body
[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5411) and poison the atmosphere
of the individual.
[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5415) A woman said to me in deep sorrow,
[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5418) &#39;Treat me to be happy and joyous,
[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5420) for my sorrow makes me so irritable
[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5422) with the members of my family
[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5424) that I keep making more karma.&#39;
[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5427) I was asked to treat a woman
[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5428) who was mourning for her daughter.
[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5430) I denied all belief in loss and separation
[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5433) and affirmed that God was the woman&#39;s joy,
[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5436) love and peace.
[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5438) The woman gained her poise at once,
[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5440) but sent word by her son
not to treat any longer,
[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5444) because she was so happy,
it wasn&#39;t respectable.
[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5448) So, mortal mind loves to hang on
[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5450) to its griefs and regrets.
[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5452) I knew a woman who went about
bragging of her troubles,
[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5455) so, of course, she always had something
[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5457) to brag about.
[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5458) The old idea was if a woman did not worry
[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5461) about her children, she
was not a good mother.
[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5464) Now, we know that
mother-fear is responsible
[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5467) for many of the diseases and accidents
[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5469) which come into the lives of children.
[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5472) For fear pictures vividly the disease
[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5474) or situation feared and
these pictures objectify,
[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5478) if not neutralized.
[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5480) Happy is the mother who can say sincerely,
[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5483) that she puts her child in God&#39;s hands
[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5486) and knows therefore, that
he is divinely protected.
[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5490) She, in this way throws about him
[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5493) a great aura of protection.
[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5495) For example, a woman awoke
suddenly in the night
[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5499) feeling her brother was in great danger.
[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5502) Instead of giving in to her fears,
[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5504) she commenced making
statements of truth, saying,
[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5507) &#39;Man is a perfect idea in divine mind
[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5511) and is always in his right place,
[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5513) therefore, my brother
is in his right place
[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5516) and is divinely protected.&#39;
[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5518) The next day she found that her brother
[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5521) had been in close proximity
[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5522) to an explosion in a mine,
[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5524) but had miraculously escaped.
[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5527) So, man is his brother&#39;s keeper in thought
[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5530) and every man should know
that the thing he loves
[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5533) dwells in the secret
place of the most high
[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5536) and abides under the
shadow of the Almighty.
[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5539) There shall no evil befall thee,
[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5542) neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.
[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5546) Perfect love casteth out fear.
[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5548) He that feareth is not
made perfect in love
[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5552) and love is the fulfilling of the law.&quot;
[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5557) Chapter eight, &quot;Intuition or Guidance&quot;.
[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5561) &quot;In all thy ways acknowledge Him
[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5564) and He shall direct thy paths.
[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5567) There is nothing too
great of accomplishment
[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5569) for the man who knows
the power of his word
[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5572) and who follows his intuitive leads.
[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5575) By the word, he starts
in action unseen forces
[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5579) and can rebuild his body
or remold his affairs.
[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5583) It is, therefore, of the utmost importance
[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5585) to choose the right words
[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5587) and the student carefully selects
[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5589) the affirmation he wishes
[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5591) to catapult into the invisible.
[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5594) He knows that God is his supply,
[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5596) that there is a supply for every demand
[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5599) and that his spoken word
releases this supply.
[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5602) Ask and ye shall receive.
[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5605) Man must make the first move.
[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5608) Draw nigh to God and He
will draw nigh to you.
[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5612) I have often been asked
[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5613) just how to make a demonstration.
[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5615) I reply, &#39;Speak the word
[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5617) and then do not do anything
[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5619) until you get a definite lead.&#39;
[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5621) Demand the lead, saying, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5624) reveal to me the way,
[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5626) let me know if there is
anything for me to do.&#39;
[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5630) The answer will come
through intuition or hunch,
[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5633) a chance remark from someone
[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5635) or a passage in a book,
et cetera, et cetera.
[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5638) The answers are sometimes quite startling
[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5640) in their exactness.
[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5642) For example, a woman desired
a large sum of money.
[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5646) She spoke the words, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5649) open the way for my immediate supply,
[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5652) let all that is mine by
divine right now reach me,
[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5655) in great avalanches of abundance.&#39;
[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5658) Then she added, &#39;Give me a definite lead,
[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5661) let me know if there is
anything for me to do.&#39;
[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5664) The thought came quickly,
[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5666) &#39;Give a certain friend,&#39;
[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5667) who had helped her spiritually, &#39;$100.&#39;
[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5671) She told her friend, who said,
[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5672) &#39;Wait and get another
lead, before giving it.&#39;
[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5675) So she waited and that day
met a woman who said to her,
[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5679) &#39;I gave someone a dollar today,
[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5681) it was just as much for me,
[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5683) as it would be for you
to give someone a 100.&#39;
[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5686) This was indeed an unmistakable lead,
[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5689) so she knew she was
right in giving the $100.
[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5692) It was a gift which
proved a great investment,
[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5695) for shortly after that,
[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5697) a large sum of money came
to her in a remarkable way.
[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5701) Giving opens the way for receiving.
[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5704) In order to create activity in finances,
[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5707) one should give.
[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5709) Tithing or giving
one-tenth of one&#39;s income
[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5711) is an old Jewish custom
[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5713) and is sure to bring increase.
[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5715) Many of the richest men in this country
[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5717) have been tithers
[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5718) and I have never known it
to fail as an investment.
[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5722) The 10th part goes forth
[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5724) and returns blessed and multiplied.
[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5727) But the gift or tithe must be given
[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5729) with love and cheerfulness,
[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5732) for God loveth a cheerful giver.
[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5735) Bills should be paid cheerfully,
[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5737) all money should be sent forth fearlessly
[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5739) and with a blessing.
[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5741) This attitude of mind
makes man master of money.
[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5745) It is his to obey and his spoken word
[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5747) then opens vast reservoirs of wealth.
[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5751) Man, himself, limits his supply
[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5753) by his limited vision.
[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5755) Sometimes the student
[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5756) has a great realization of wealth,
[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5758) but is afraid to act.
[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5760) The vision and action
must go hand in hand,
[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5764) as in the case of the man who bought
[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5766) the fur-lined overcoat.
[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5768) A woman came to me asking me
[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5769) to speak the word for a position.
[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5772) So I demanded, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5775) open the way for this
woman&#39;s right position.&#39;
[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5778) Never ask for just a position,
[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5780) ask for the right position,
[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5782) the place already planned in divine mind,
[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5785) as it is the only one that
will give satisfaction.
[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5789) I then gave thanks that
she had already received
[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5791) and that it would manifest quickly.
[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5794) Very soon, she had three
positions offered her.
[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5798) Two in New York and one in Palm Beach
[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5800) and she did not know which to choose.
[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5802) I said, &#39;Ask for a definite lead.&#39;
[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5805) The time was almost up
and was still undecided,
[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5808) when one day, she telephoned,
[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5810) &#39;When I woke up this morning,
[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5812) I could smell Palm Beach.&#39;
[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5814) She had been there before
[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5815) and knew its balmy fragrance.
[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5818) I replied, &#39;Well, if you can
smell Palm Beach from here,
[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5821) it is certainly your lead.&#39;
[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5823) She accepted the position
[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5825) and it proved a great success.
[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5827) Often, one&#39;s lead comes
at an unexpected time.
[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5831) One day, I was walking down the street
[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5834) when I suddenly felt a strong urge
[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5836) to go to a certain bakery,
a block or two away.
[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5839) The reasoning mind resisted, arguing,
[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5841) &#39;There is nothing there that you want.&#39;
[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5844) However, I had learned not to reason,
[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5846) so I went to the bakery,
looked at everything
[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5850) and there was certainly
nothing there that I wanted,
[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5853) but coming out I encountered a woman
[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5855) I had thought of often
[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5856) and who was in great need of the help
[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5858) which I could give her.
[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5860) So often, one goes for one thing
[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5863) and finds another.
[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5865) Intuition is a spiritual faculty
[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5867) and does not explain,
[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5869) but simply points the way.
[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5872) A person often receives a lead
[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5874) during a treatment.
[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5875) The idea that comes may
seem quite irrelevant,
[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5878) but some of God&#39;s leadings are mysterious.
[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5882) In the class, one day,
[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5883) I was treating that each individual
[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5885) would receive a definite lead.
[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5887) A woman came to me afterwards and said,
[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5890) &#39;While you were treating,
[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5891) I got the hunch to take my
furniture out of storage
[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5894) and get an apartment.&#39;
[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5896) The woman had come to
be treated for health.
[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5899) I told her I knew in
getting a home of her own,
[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5901) her health would improve and I added,
[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5904) &#39;I believe your trouble,
which is a congestion,
[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5907) has come from having things stored away.
[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5910) Congestion of things causes
congestion in the body.
[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5914) You have violated the law of use
[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5916) and your body is paying the penalty.&#39;
[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5918) So, I gave thanks that
divine order was established
[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5922) in her mind, body and affairs.
[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5925) People little dream of how their affairs
[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5927) react on the body.
[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5929) There is a mental correspondence
for every disease.
[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5932) A person might receive
instantaneous healing
[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5935) through the realization of his body
[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5937) being a perfect idea in divine mind
[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5940) and therefore, whole and perfect,
[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5943) but if he continues his
destructive thinking,
[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5945) hoarding, hating, fearing, condemning,
[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5949) the disease will return.
[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5951) Jesus Christ knew that all
sickness came from sin,
[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5954) but admonished the
leper after the healing,
[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5957) to go and sin no more,
[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5959) lest a worse thing come upon him.
[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5962) So, man&#39;s soul or subconscious mind
[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5964) must be washed whiter than snow
[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5967) for permanent healing
[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5968) and the metaphysician
is always delving deep
[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5971) for the correspondence.
[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5973) Jesus Christ said,
[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5974) &#39;Condemn not lest ye also be condemned.
[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5978) Judge not, lest ye be judged.&#39;
[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5981) Many people have attracted disease
[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5983) and unhappiness through
condemnation of others.
[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5987) What man condemns in others,
[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5989) he attracts to himself.
[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5991) For example, a friend came
to me in anger and distress
[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5995) because her husband had deserted her
[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5997) for another woman.
[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=5998) She condemned the other woman
[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6000) and said continually,
[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6001) &#39;She knew he was a married man
[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6004) and had no right to
accept his attentions.&#39;
[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6007) I replied, &#39;Stop condemning
the woman, bless her
[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6010) and be through with the situation,
[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6013) otherwise, you are attracting
[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6014) the same thing to yourself.&#39;
[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6017) She was deaf to my words
and a year or two later,
[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6020) became deeply interested
in a married man herself.
[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6024) Man picks up a live-wire
whenever he criticizes
[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6027) or condemns and may expect a shock.
[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6030) Indecision is a stumbling-block
[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6033) in many a pathway.
[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6035) In order to overcome it,
[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6036) make the statement, repeatedly,
[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6038) &#39;I am always under direct inspiration,
[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6041) I make right decisions quickly.&#39;
[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6045) These words impress the subconscious
[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6047) and soon one finds
himself awake and alert,
[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6050) making his right moves without hesitation.
[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6054) I have found it destructive
[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6056) to look to the psychic plane for guidance,
[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6058) as it is the plane of many minds
[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6060) and not the one mind.
[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6062) As man opens his mind to subjectivity,
[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6065) he becomes a target
for destructive forces.
[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6068) The psychic plane is the result
[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6070) of man&#39;s mortal thought
[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6072) and is on the plane of opposites.
[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6075) He may receive either
good or bad messages.
[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6079) The science of numbers and
the reading of horoscopes,
[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6081) keep man down on the
mental or mortal plane,
[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6084) for they deal only with the karmic path.
[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6088) I know of a man who should
have been dead years ago,
[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6091) according to his horoscope,
[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6093) but he is alive and a leader
[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6094) of one of the biggest
movements in this country
[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6097) for the uplift of humanity.
[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6100) It takes a very strong mind
[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6101) to neutralize a prophecy of evil.
[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6104) The student should declare,
[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6105) &#39;Every false prophecy
shall come to naught,
[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6109) every plan my Father in
heaven has not planned,
[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6112) shall be dissolved and dissipated,
[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6114) the divine idea now comes to pass.&#39;
[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6118) However, if any good message
has ever been given one
[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6121) of coming happiness or wealth,
[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6124) harbor and expect it
[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6125) and it will manifest sooner or later
[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6128) through the law of expectancy.
[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6131) Man&#39;s will should be used
to back the universal will.
[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6134) I will that the will of God be done.
[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6138) It is God&#39;s will to give every man
[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6140) every righteous desire of his heart
[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6142) and man&#39;s will should be used
[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6144) to hold the perfect
vision without wavering.
[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6148) The prodigal son said,
[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6150) &#39;I will arise and go to my father.&#39;
[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6153) It is, indeed, often an effort of the will
[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6156) to leave the husks and
swine of mortal thinking.
[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6159) It is so much easier
for the average person
[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6162) to have fear than faith,
[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6164) so faith is an effort of the will.
[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6167) As man becomes spiritually awakened,
[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6170) he recognizes that any external inharmony
[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6173) is the correspondence of mental inharmony.
[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6176) If he stumbles or falls,
[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6178) he may know he is stumbling
[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6180) or falling in consciousness.
[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6182) One day, a student was
walking along the street
[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6185) condemning someone in her thoughts.
[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6188) She was saying, mentally,
[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6189) &#39;That woman is the most
disagreeable woman on earth,&#39;
[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6193) when suddenly three boy
scouts rushed around the comer
[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6196) and almost knocked her over.
[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6198) She did not condemn the boy scouts,
[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6200) but immediately called
on the law of forgiveness
[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6203) and saluted the divinity in the woman.
[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6206) Wisdom&#39;s way are ways of pleasantness
[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6209) and all her paths are peace.
[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6212) When one has made his
demands upon the universal,
[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6215) he must be ready for surprises.
[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6218) Everything may seem to be going wrong,
[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6219) when in reality, it is going right.
[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6222) For example, a woman was told
[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6224) that there was no loss in divine mind,
[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6227) therefore, she could not lose anything
[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6230) which belonged to her.
[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6231) Anything lost would be returned
[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6234) or she would receive its equivalent.
[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6237) Several years previously,
[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6239) she had lost $2,000.
[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6241) She had loaned the money to a relative
[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6243) during her lifetime,
[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6244) but the relative had died,
[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6246) leaving no mention of it in her will.
[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6248) The woman was resentful and angry
[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6250) and as she had no written
statement of the transaction,
[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6254) she never received the money,
[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6255) so she determined to deny the loss
[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6258) and collect the $2,000
[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6260) from the bank of the universal.
[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6262) She had to begin by forgiving the woman,
[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6265) as resentment and unforgiveness
[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6266) close the doors of this wonderful bank.
[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6270) She made this statement, &#39;I deny loss,
[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6273) there is no loss in divine mind,
[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6275) therefore, I cannot lose the $2,000
[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6278) which belong to me by divine right.
[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6281) As one door shuts, another door opens.
[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6285) She was living in an apartment house
[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6287) which was for sale and in
the lease was a clause,
[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6291) stating that if the house was sold,
[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6293) the tenants would be required
[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6294) to move out within 90 days.
[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6297) Suddenly, the landlord broke the leases
[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6299) and raised the rent.
[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6301) Again, injustice was on her pathway,
[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6304) but this time she was undisturbed.
[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6307) She blessed the landlord and said,
[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6309) &#39;As the rent has been raised,
[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6311) it means that I&#39;ll be that much richer,
[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6313) for God is my supply.&#39;
[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6315) New leases were made out
for the advanced rent,
[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6318) but by some divine mistake,
[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6320) the 90 days clause had been forgotten.
[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6323) Soon after, the landlord
had an opportunity
[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6326) to sell the house.
[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6328) On account of the mistake
in the new leases,
[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6330) the tenants held possession
for another year.
[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6333) The agent offered each tenant $2,000
[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6336) if he would vacate.
[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6337) Several families moved,
[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6339) three remained, including the woman.
[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6342) A month or two passed and
the agent again appeared.
[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6345) This time he said to the woman,
[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6347) &#39;Will you break your lease
for the sum of $1,500?&#39;
[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6351) It flashed upon her,
&#39;Here comes the $2,000.&#39;
[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6355) She remembered having said
[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6356) to friends in the house,
[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6357) &#39;We will all act together
[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6359) if anything more is said about leaving.&#39;
[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6361) So her lead was to consult her friends.
[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6365) These friends said,
[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6366) &#39;Well, if they have offered you 1,500,
[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6369) they will certainly give 2,000.&#39;
[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6372) So, she received a check for $2,000
[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6374) for giving up the apartment.
[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6376) It was certainly a
remarkable working of the law
[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6379) and the apparent injustice
[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6381) was merely opening the
way for her demonstration.
[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6384) It proved that there is no loss
[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6387) and when man takes his spiritual stand,
[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6389) he collects all that is his
[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6391) from this great reservoir of good.
[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6394) I will restore to you the years
[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6396) the locusts have eaten.
[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6398) The locusts are the
doubts, fears, resentments
[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6401) and regrets of mortal thinking.
[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6404) These adverse thoughts alone rob man,
[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6407) for no man gives to himself, but himself
[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6411) and no man takes away
from himself, but himself.
[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6416) Man is here to prove God
[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6417) and to bear witness to the truth
[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6420) and he can only prove God
[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6422) by bringing plenty out of lack
[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6424) and justice out of injustice.
[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6427) &#39;Prove me now herewith,&#39;
[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6429) saith the Lord of hosts,
[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6430) &#39;if I will not open you
the windows of heaven
[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6434) and pour out a blessing,
[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6436) that there shall not be
room enough to receive it.&#39;&quot;
[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6441) Chapter nine, &quot;Perfect Self-Expression
[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6444) or the Divine Design&quot;.
[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6447) &quot;No wind can drive my bark astray
[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6450) nor change the tide of destiny.
[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6453) There is for each man,
perfect self-expression.
[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6456) There is a place which he is to fill
[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6458) and no one else can fill,
[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6460) something which he is to do,
[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6462) which no one else can do,
[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6464) it is his destiny!
[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6466) This achievement is held,
[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6468) a perfect idea in divine mind,
[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6470) awaiting man&#39;s recognition.
[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6473) As the imaging faculty
is the creative faculty,
[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6476) it is necessary for man to see the idea
[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6479) before it can manifest.
[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6481) So, man&#39;s highest demand
[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6483) is for the divine design of his life.
[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6486) He may not have the faintest conception
[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6488) of what it is, for there is, possibly,
[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6490) some marvelous talent
hidden deep within him.
[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6494) His demand should be, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6497) open the way for the divine design
[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6499) of my life to manifest,
[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6501) let the genius within me now be released,
[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6504) let me see clearly the perfect plan.&#39;
[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6508) The perfect plan includes
health, wealth, love
[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6511) and perfect self-expression.
[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6514) This is the square of life,
[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6516) which brings perfect happiness.
[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6518) When one has made this demand,
[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6520) he may find great changes
taking place in his life,
[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6524) for nearly every man has wandered far
[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6526) from the divine design.
[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6529) I know, in one woman&#39;s case,
[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6530) it was as though a cyclone
had struck her affairs,
[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6534) but readjustments came quickly
[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6536) and new and wonderful conditions
[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6538) took the place of old ones.
[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6540) Perfect self-expression
will never be labor,
[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6543) but of such absorbing interest
[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6545) that it will seem almost like play.
[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6548) The student knows, also, as man comes
[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6550) into the world financed by God,
[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6553) the supply needed for his
perfect self-expression
[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6556) will be at hand.
[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6558) Many a genius has struggled for years
[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6560) with the problem of supply
[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6562) when his spoken word and faith
[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6564) would have released quickly,
[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6565) the necessary funds.
[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6567) For example, after the class one day,
[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6570) a man came to me and handed me a cent.
[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6573) He said, &#39;I have just
seven cents in the world
[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6577) and I&#39;m going to give you one
[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6579) for I have faith in the
power of your spoken word.
[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6582) I want you to speak the word
[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6584) for my perfect self-expression
and prosperity.&#39;
[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6587) I spoke the word and did not see him again
[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6590) until a year later.
[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6592) He came in one day, successful and happy,
[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6594) with a roll of yellow bills in his pocket.
[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6597) He said, &#39;Immediately
after you spoke the word,
[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6600) I had a position offered
me in a distant city
[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6603) and am now demonstrating health,
[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6605) happiness and supply.&#39;
[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6608) A woman&#39;s perfect self-expression
[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6610) may be in becoming a perfect wife,
[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6612) a perfect mother, a perfect home-maker
[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6614) and not necessarily in
having a perfect career.
[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6618) Demand definite leads
[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6619) and the way will be made
easy and successful.
[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6623) One should not visualize
or force a mental picture.
[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6627) When he demands the divine design
[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6629) to come into his conscious mind,
[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6630) he will receive flashes of inspiration
[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6633) and begin to see himself
[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6635) making some great accomplishment.
[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6637) This is the picture
[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6638) or idea he must hold without wavering.
[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6642) The thing man seeks is seeking him,
[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6645) the telephone was seeking Bell!
[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6648) Parents should never force careers
[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6650) and professions upon their children.
[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6652) With a knowledge of spiritual truth,
[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6654) the divine plan could be spoken for,
[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6656) early in childhood or prenatally.
[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6659) A prenatal treatment should be,
[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6661) &#39;Let the God in this child
have perfect expression,
[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6665) let the divine design of
his mind, body and affairs
[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6669) be made manifest throughout his life,
[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6672) throughout eternity.&#39;
[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6674) God&#39;s will be done, not man&#39;s,
[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6677) God&#39;s pattern, not man&#39;s pattern,
[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6680) is the command we find running through
[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6682) all the scriptures
[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6683) and the Bible is a book dealing
[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6685) with the science of the mind.
[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6688) It is a book telling man
how to release his soul
[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6690) or subconscious mind from bondage.
[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6694) The battles described are pictures
[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6696) of man waging war against mortal thoughts.
[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6700) A man&#39;s foes shall be
they of his own household.
[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6704) Every man is Jehoshaphat
and every man is David,
[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6707) who slays Goliath, mortal thinking
[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6710) with the little white stone, faith.
[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6713) So, man must be careful
that he is not the wicked
[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6716) and slothful servant
who buried his talent.
[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6720) There is a terrible penalty to be paid
[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6722) for not using one&#39;s ability.
[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6724) Often, fear stands between man
[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6726) and his perfect self-expression.
[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6729) Stage-fright has hampered many a genius.
[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6732) This may be overcome by the
spoken word or treatment.
[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6736) The individual then loses
all self-consciousness
[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6739) and feels simply that he is a channel
[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6741) for infinite intelligence
to express itself through.
[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6744) He is under direct inspiration,
[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6747) fearless and confident,
[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6749) for he feels that it is
the Father within him
[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6751) who does the work.
[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6753) A young boy came often to
my class with his mother.
[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6756) He asked me to speak the word
[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6758) for his coming examinations at school.
[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6761) I told him to make the statement,
[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6763) &#39;I am one with infinite intelligence.
[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6766) I know everything I should
know on this subject.&#39;
[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6769) He had an excellent knowledge of history,
[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6771) but was not sure of his arithmetic.
[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6774) I saw him afterwards and he said,
[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6776) &#39;I spoke the word for my arithmetic
[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6778) and passed with the highest honors,
[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6780) but thought I could depend
on myself for history
[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6783) and got a very poor mark.&#39;
[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6786) Man often receives a set-back
[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6788) when he is too sure of himself,
[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6790) which means he is trusting
to his personality
[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6793) and not the Father within.
[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6795) Another one of my students
gave me an example of this.
[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6799) She took an extended
trip abroad one summer,
[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6801) visiting many countries,
[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6803) where she was ignorant of the languages.
[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6806) She was calling for guidance
[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6807) and protection every minute
[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6809) and her affairs went
smoothly and miraculously.
[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6812) Her luggage was never delayed nor lost!
[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6815) Accommodations were always ready for her
[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6817) at the best hotels
[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6818) and she had perfect
service wherever she went.
[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6822) She returned to New York.
[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6824) Knowing the language,
[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6825) she felt God was no longer necessary,
[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6827) so looked after her affairs
in an ordinary manner.
[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6831) Everything went wrong,
[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6833) her trunks delayed amid
inharmony and confusion.
[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6837) The student must form the habit
[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6839) of practicing the presence
of God every minute.
[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6842) In all thy ways acknowledge him,
[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6845) nothing is too small or too great.
[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6849) Sometimes an insignificant incident
[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6851) may be the turning point in a man&#39;s life.
[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6854) Robert Fulton, watching some boiling water
[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6857) simmering in a tea
kettle, saw a steamboat!
[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6861) I have seen a student,
[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6862) often, keep back his demonstration
[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6864) through resistance or pointing the way.
[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6867) He pins his faith to one channel only
[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6870) and dictates just the way he desires
[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6872) the manifestation to come,
[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6874) which brings things to a standstill.
[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6876) &#39;My way, not your way,&#39;
[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6878) is the command of infinite intelligence.
[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6881) Like all power, be it
steam or electricity,
[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6884) it must have a non-resistant engine
[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6887) or instrument to work through
[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6889) and man is that engine or instrument.
[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6892) Over and over again, man
is told to stand still.
[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6896) &#39;Oh Judah, fear not, but
tomorrow go out against them,
[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6901) for the Lord will be with you.
[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6903) You shall not need to fight this battle,
[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6906) set yourselves, stand ye still
[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6909) and see the salvation
of the Lord with you.&#39;
[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6912) We see this in the incidents of the $2,000
[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6915) coming to the woman through the landlord
[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6917) when she became
non-resistant and undisturbed
[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6921) and the woman who won the man&#39;s love
[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6923) after all suffering had ceased.
[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6926) The student&#39;s goal is poise!
[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6928) Poise is power, for it gives God&#39;s power
[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6932) a chance to rush through man,
[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6934) to will and to do its good pleasure.
[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6937) Poised, he thinks clearly
[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6939) and makes right decisions quickly.
[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6941) He never misses a trick.
[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6944) Anger blurs the visions,
poisons the blood,
[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6947) is the root of many diseases
[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6948) and causes wrong decision
leading to failure.
[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6952) It has been named one of the worst sins
[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6955) as its reaction is so harmful.
[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6957) The student learns that in metaphysics,
[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6960) sin has a much broader meaning
[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6962) than in the old teaching.
[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6964) Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6967) He finds that fear and
worry are deadly sins.
[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6971) They are inverted faith
[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6973) and through distorted mental pictures,
[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6975) bring to pass the thing he fears.
[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6978) His work is to drive out these enemies
[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6980) from the subconscious mind.
[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6983) When man&#39;s fearless, he is finished.
[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6986) Maeterlinck says that man is God afraid.
[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6990) So, as we read in the previous chapters,
[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6993) man can only vanquish fear by walking up
[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6995) to the thing he is afraid of.
[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=6998) When Jehoshaphat and his army
prepared to meet the enemy,
[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7001) singing &#39;Praise the Lord,
[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7002) for his mercy endureth forever,&#39;
[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7005) they found their enemies
had destroyed each other
[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7008) and there was nothing to fight.
[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7010) For example, a woman asked a friend
[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7013) to deliver a message to another friend.
[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7015) The woman feared to give the message,
[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7017) as the reasoning mind said,
[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7019) &#39;Don&#39;t get mixed-up in this affair,
[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7021) don&#39;t give that message.&#39;
[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7023) She was troubled in spirit
[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7025) for she had given her promise.
[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7027) At last, she determined
to walk up to the lion
[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7030) and call on the law of divine protection.
[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7033) She met the friend
[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7034) to whom she was to deliver the message.
[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7036) She opened her mouth to speak it,
[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7038) when her friend said,
&#39;So-and-so has left town.&#39;
[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7041) This made it unnecessary
to give the message,
[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7044) as the situation depended
upon the person being in town.
[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7048) As she was willing to do it,
[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7050) she was not obliged to,
[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7051) as she did not fear,
the situation vanished.
[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7056) The student often delays his demonstration
[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7058) through a belief in incompletion.
[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7061) He should make this statement,
[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7063) &#39;In divine mind there is only completion,
[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7066) therefore, my demonstration is completed.
[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7070) My perfect work, my perfect home,
[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7073) my perfect health.&#39;
[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7075) Whatever he demands are perfect ideas
[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7077) registered in divine mind
[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7079) and must manifest under
grace in a perfect way.
[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7084) He gives thanks he has already
received on the invisible
[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7088) and makes active preparation
[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7090) for receiving on the visible.
[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7092) One of my students
[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7094) was in need of a financial demonstration.
[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7096) She came to me and asked
why it was not completed.
[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7100) I replied, &#39;Perhaps, you are in the habit
[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7103) of leaving things unfinished
[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7105) and the subconscious has
gotten into the habit
[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7107) of not completing.
[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7108) As the without, so the within.&#39;
[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7111) She said, &#39;You are right.
[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7113) I often begin things
and never finish them.
[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7116) I&#39;ll go home and finish
something I commenced weeks ago
[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7119) and I know it will be
symbolic of my demonstration.&#39;
[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7122) So, she sewed assiduously
[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7125) and the article was soon completed.
[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7127) Shortly after, the money came
[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7129) in a most curious manner.
[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7132) Her husband was paid his
salary twice that month.
[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7135) He told the people of their mistake
[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7137) and they sent word to keep it.
[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7140) When man asks, believing, he must receive,
[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7143) for God creates His own channels!
[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7146) I have been sometimes asked,
[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7148) &#39;Suppose one has several talents,
[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7151) how is he to know which one to choose?&#39;
[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7154) Demand to be shown definitely.
[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7156) Say, &#39;Infinite Spirit,
give me a definite lead,
[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7160) reveal to me my perfect self-expression,
[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7164) show me which talent I
am to make use of now.&#39;
[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7167) I have known people to suddenly enter
[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7170) a new line of work and be fully equipped,
[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7173) with little or no training.
[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7174) So make the statement,
&#39;I am fully equipped
[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7177) for the divine plan of my life&#39;
[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7179) and be fearless in grasping opportunities.
[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7183) Some people are cheerful givers,
[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7185) but bad receivers.
[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7187) They refuse gifts through pride
[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7189) or some negative reason,
[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7190) thereby blocking their channels
[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7192) and invariably find themselves eventually
[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7195) with little or nothing.
[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7197) For example, a woman who had given away
[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7200) a great deal of money,
[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7201) had a gift offered her of
several thousand dollars.
[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7205) She refused to take it
saying she did not need it.
[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7208) Shortly after that, her
finances were tied up
[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7211) and she found herself
in debt for that amount.
[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7214) Man should receive gracefully
[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7216) the bread returning to him upon the water.
[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7219) Freely ye have given,
freely ye shall receive.
[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7223) There is always the perfect balance
[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7226) of giving and receiving
[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7227) and though man should give
[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7229) without thinking of returns,
[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7231) he violates law if he does
not accept the returns
[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7234) which come to him,
[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7235) for all gifts are from God,
[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7238) man being merely the channel.
[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7241) A thought of lack should
never be held over the giver.
[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7244) For example, when the
man gave me the one cent,
[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7248) I did not say, &#39;Poor man, he cannot afford
[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7251) to give me that.&#39;
[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7252) I saw him rich and prosperous,
[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7254) with his supply pouring in.
[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7257) It was this thought which brought it.
[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7259) If one has been a bad receiver,
[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7261) he must become a good one
[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7263) and take even a postage
stamp if it is given him
[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7266) and open up his channels for receiving.
[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7269) The Lord loveth a cheerful receiver,
[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7271) as well as a cheerful giver.
[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7273) I have often been asked why one man
[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7275) is born rich and healthy
[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7277) and another poor and sick.
[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7279) Where there is an effect
there is always a cause,
[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7282) there is no such thing as chance.
[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7285) This question is answered
[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7286) through the law of reincarnation.
[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7289) Man goes through many births and deaths,
[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7291) until he knows the truth
which sets him free.
[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7295) He is drawn back to the earth plane
[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7297) through unsatisfied desire
to pay his karmic debts
[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7301) or to fulfill his destiny.
[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7303) The man born rich and healthy
[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7305) has had pictures in his subconscious mind,
[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7307) in his past life, of health and riches
[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7310) and the poor and sick man,
of disease and poverty.
[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7314) Man manifests on any plane,
[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7316) the sum total of his subconscious beliefs.
[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7319) However, birth and
death are man-made laws,
[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7323) for the wages of sin is death.
[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7326) The Adamic fall in consciousness
[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7327) through the belief in two powers.
[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7330) The real man, spiritual man,
[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7332) is birthless and deathless!
[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7335) He never was born and has never died.
[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7338) As he was in the beginning,
[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7340) he is now and ever shall be!
[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7343) So, through the truth, man is set free
[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7346) from the law of karma, sin and death
[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7349) and manifests the man made
[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7351) in His image and likeness.
[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7354) Man&#39;s freedom comes through
fulfilling his destiny,
[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7357) bringing into manifestation
[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7359) the divine design of his life.
[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7362) His Lord will say unto him,
[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7364) &#39;Well done thou good and faithful servant,
[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7367) thou hast been faithful over a few things,
[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7370) I will make thee ruler over
many things, death itself,
[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7375) enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,
[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7378) eternal life.&#39;&quot;
[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7380) Chapter 10, &quot;Denial and Affirmations&quot;.
[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7385) &quot;Thou shalt also decree a thing
[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7387) and it shall be established unto thee.
[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7391) All the good that is to be made manifest
[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7393) in man&#39;s life is already
an accomplished fact
[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7397) in divine mind
[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7398) and is released through man&#39;s recognition
[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7401) or spoken word.
[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7402) So, he must be careful to decree
[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7405) that only the divine
idea be made manifest,
[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7408) for often, he decrees
through his idle words,
[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7412) failure or misfortune.
[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7414) It is, therefore, of
the utmost importance,
[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7417) to word one&#39;s demands correctly
[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7419) as stated in a previous chapter.
[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7421) If one desires a home, friend, position
[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7425) or any other good thing, make the demand
[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7427) for the divine selection.
[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7429) For example, &#39;Infinite
Spirit, open the way
[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7433) for my right home, my right friend,
[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7436) my right position.
[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7438) I give thanks it now manifests under grace
[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7441) in a perfect way.&#39;
[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7443) The latter part of the statement
[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7445) is most important.
[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7446) For example, I knew a
woman who demanded $1,000.
[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7450) Her daughter was injured
[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7452) and they received $1,000 indemnity,
[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7455) so it did not come in a perfect way.
[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7457) The demand should have
been worded in this way,
[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7461) &#39;Infinite Spirit, I give
thanks that the $1,000,
[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7464) which is mine by divine
right is now released
[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7468) and reaches me under
grace in a perfect way.&#39;
[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7472) As one grows in a financial consciousness,
[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7475) he should demand that the
enormous sums of money,
[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7477) which are his by divine right,
[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7479) reach him under grace, in perfect ways.
[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7483) It is impossible for man to release
[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7485) more than he thinks is possible,
[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7487) for one is bound by the
limited expectancies
[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7490) of the subconscious.
[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7492) He must enlarge his expectancies
[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7494) in order to receive in a larger way.
[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7497) Man so often limits
himself in his demands.
[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7500) For example, a student
made the demand for $600
[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7504) by a certain date.
[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7505) He did receive it, but heard afterwards,
[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7508) that he came very near receiving $1,000,
[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7511) but he was given just 600
[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7514) as the result of his spoken word.
[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7517) They limited the Holy One of Israel.
[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7520) Wealth is a matter of consciousness.
[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7522) The French have a legend
giving an example of this.
[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7525) A poor man was walking along a road
[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7528) when he met a traveler
who stopped him and said,
[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7530) &#39;My good friend, I see you are poor.
[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7534) Take this gold nugget, sell it
[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7536) and you will be rich all your days.&#39;
[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7539) The man was overjoyed at his good fortune
[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7541) and took the nugget home.
[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7543) He immediately found work
and became so prosperous
[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7546) that he did not sell the nugget.
[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7549) Years passed and he
became a very rich man.
[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7552) One day he met a poor man on the road.
[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7555) He stopped him and said, &#39;My good friend,
[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7558) I will give you this gold nugget,
[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7560) which, if you sell, will
make you rich for life.&#39;
[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7563) The mendicant took the
nugget, had it valued
[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7566) and found it was only brass.
[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7568) So, we see, the first man became rich
[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7570) through feeling rich
thinking the nugget was gold.
[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7574) Every man has within
himself a gold nugget,
[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7578) it is his consciousness
of gold, of opulence,
[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7580) which brings riches into his life.
[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7583) In making his demands,
[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7585) man begins at his journey&#39;s end,
[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7588) that is, he declares he
has already received.
[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7592) Before ye call, I shall answer.
[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7596) Continually affirming,
establishes the belief
[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7599) in the subconscious.
[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7601) It would not be necessary
[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7602) to make an affirmation more than once
[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7604) if one had perfect faith!
[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7606) One should not plead or supplicate,
[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7609) but give thanks repeatedly
that he has received.
[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7612) The desert shall rejoice
and blossom as the rose.
[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7617) This rejoicing which is yet in the desert,
[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7619) state of consciousness,
[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7621) opens the way for release.
[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7623) The Lord&#39;s Prayer
[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7624) is in the form of command and demand,
[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7626) &#39;Give us this day our daily bread
[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7629) and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors&#39;
[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7633) and ends in praise,
[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7635) &#39;For thine is the Kingdom
[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7637) and the Power and the Glory, forever.
[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7640) Amen.&#39;
[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7641) Concerning the works of my hands,
[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7643) command ye me.
[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7645) So, prayer is command and demand,
[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7648) praise and thanksgiving.
[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7650) The student&#39;s work is in
making himself believe
[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7653) that with God all things are possible.
[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7657) This is easy enough to
state in the abstract,
[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7659) but a little more
difficult when confronted
[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7662) with a problem.
[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7663) For example, it was necessary for a woman
[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7666) to demonstrate a large sum of money
[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7668) within a stated time.
[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7670) She knew she must do something
to get a realization,
[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7673) for realization is manifestation
[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7676) and she demanded a lead.
[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7678) She was walking through a department store
[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7680) when she saw a very beautiful
[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7682) pink enamel paper-cutter.
[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7685) She felt the pull towards it.
[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7687) The thought came,
[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7687) &#39;I haven&#39;t a paper cutter good enough
[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7689) to open letters containing large cheques.&#39;
[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7692) So, she bought the paper-cutter,
[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7694) which the reasoning mind
[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7695) would have called an extravagance.
[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7698) When she held it in her hand,
[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7699) she had a flash of a picture of herself
[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7701) opening an envelope
containing a large cheque
[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7705) and in a few weeks,
she received the money.
[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7708) The pink paper-cutter was
her bridge of active faith.
[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7712) Many stories are told of the
power of the subconscious
[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7715) when directed in faith.
[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7717) For example, a man was spending the night
[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7719) in a farmhouse.
[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7721) The windows of the room
had been nailed down
[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7723) and in the middle of the
night he felt suffocated
[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7726) and made his way in
the dark to the window.
[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7729) He could not open it,
[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7730) so he smashed the pane with his fist,
[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7733) drew in draughts of fine fresh air
[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7735) and had a wonderful night&#39;s sleep.
[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7738) The next morning, he found he had smashed
[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7740) the glass of a bookcase
[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7742) and the window had remained closed
[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7744) during the whole night.
[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7746) He had supplied himself with oxygen,
[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7748) simply by his thought of oxygen.
[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7752) When a student starts out to demonstrate,
[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7754) he should never turn back.
[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7756) Let not that man who wavers
[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7758) think that he shall receive
anything of the Lord.
[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7761) A student once made this
wonderful statement,
[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7764) &#39;When I asks the Father for anything,
[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7767) I puts my foot down and I say,
[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7769) Father, I&#39;ll take nothing less
[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7771) than I&#39;ve asked for, but more!&#39;
[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7774) So, man should never compromise.
[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7776) Having done all, stand.
[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7778) This is sometimes
[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7780) the most difficult time of demonstrating.
[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7782) The temptation comes to give up,
[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7784) to turn back, to compromise.
[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7787) He also serves who only stands and waits.
[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7792) Demonstrations often come at the 11th hour
[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7795) because man then lets go,
[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7796) that is, stops reasoning
[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7798) and infinite intelligence
has a chance to work.
[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7802) Man&#39;s dreary desires are answered drearily
[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7805) and his impatient desires,
[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7806) long delayed or violently fulfilled.
[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7809) For example, a woman asked me why it was
[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7812) she was constantly losing
or breaking her glasses.
[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7816) We found she often said to herself
[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7818) and others with vexation,
[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7819) &#39;I wish I could get rid of my glasses.&#39;
[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7822) So, her impatient desire
was violently fulfilled.
[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7826) What she should have demanded
was perfect eye-sight,
[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7829) but what she registered
in the subconscious
[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7831) was simply the impatient desire
[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7833) to be rid of her glasses,
[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7835) so they were continually
being broken or lost.
[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7838) Two attitudes of mind
cause loss, depreciation,
[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7841) as in the case of the woman
[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7843) who did not appreciate her husband
[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7845) or fear of loss,
[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7847) which makes a picture of
loss in the subconscious.
[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7850) When a student is able
to let go of his problem,
[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7853) cast his burden,
[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7854) he will have instantaneous manifestation.
[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7857) For example, a woman was
out during a very stormy day
[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7861) and her umbrella was blown inside-out.
[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7864) She was about to make
a call on some people
[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7866) whom she had never met
and she did not wish
[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7869) to make her first appearance
[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7870) with a dilapidated umbrella.
[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7873) She could not throw it away,
[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7874) as it did not belong to her.
[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7876) So, in desperation, she exclaimed,
[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7878) &#39;Oh, God, you take
charge of this umbrella,
[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7881) I don&#39;t know what to do.&#39;
[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7883) A moment later, a voice behind her said,
[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7887) &#39;Lady, do you want your umbrella mended?&#39;
[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7889) There stood an umbrella mender.
[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7892) She replied, &#39;Indeed, I do.&#39;
[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7895) The man mended the umbrella
[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7896) while she went into the
house to pay her call
[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7898) and when she returned,
she had a good umbrella.
[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7902) So, there is always an
umbrella mender at hand
[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7904) on man&#39;s pathway when
one puts the umbrella
[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7907) or situation in God&#39;s Hands.
[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7911) One should always follow a denial
[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7913) with an affirmation.
[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7914) For example, I was called
on the phone late one night
[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7917) to treat a man whom I had never seen.
[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7920) He was apparently very ill.
[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7922) I made the statement,
[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7923) &#39;I deny this appearance of disease.
[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7926) It is unreal, therefore cannot register
[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7929) in his consciousness.
[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7931) This man is a perfect idea in divine mind,
[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7934) pure substance expressing perfection.
[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7937) The next morning, he was much better
[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7940) and the following day,
[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7941) out attending to his business.
[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7943) There is no time or space in divine mind,
[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7946) therefore the word reaches
instantly its destination
[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7950) and does not return void.
[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7952) I have treated patients in Europe
[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7954) and have found that the
result was instantaneous.
[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7958) I am asked so often the difference
[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7960) between visualizing and visioning.
[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7962) Visualizing is a mental process
[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7965) governed by the reasoning
or conscious mind,
[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7968) visioning is a spiritual process
[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7970) governed by intuition or
the super-conscious mind.
[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7974) The student should train his mind
[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7976) to receive these flashes of inspiration
[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7978) and work out the divine pictures
[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7980) through definite leads.
[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7982) When a man can say, &#39;I
desire only that which
[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7985) God desires for me,&#39;
[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7987) his false desires fade
from the consciousness
[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7990) and a new set of blueprints is given him
[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7992) by the master architect, the God within.
[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7996) God&#39;s plan for each man
transcends the limitation
[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=7999) of the reasoning mind
[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8001) and is always the square of life,
[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8003) containing health, wealth,
[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8005) love and perfect self-expression.
[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8009) Many a man is building for himself
[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8011) in imagination a bungalow
[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8013) when he should be building a palace.
[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8016) If a student tries to
force a demonstration,
[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8018) through the reasoning mind,
[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8020) he brings it to a standstill.
[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8022) &#39;I will hasten it,&#39; saith the Lord.
[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8025) He should act only through intuition
[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8027) or definite leads.
[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8029) Rest in the Lord and wait patiently.
[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8031) Trust also in him and he
will bring it to pass.
[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8036) I have seen the law work
[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8037) in the most astonishing manner.
[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8040) For example, a student
stated that it was necessary
[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8043) for her to have $100 by the following day.
[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8046) It was a debt of vital importance
[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8048) which had to be met.
[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8050) I spoke the word declaring
Spirit was never too late
[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8054) and that the supply was at hand.
[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8057) That evening she phoned me of the miracle.
[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8060) She said that the thought came to her
[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8061) to go to her safe-deposit box at the bank
[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8064) to examine some papers.
[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8066) She looked over the papers
[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8068) and at the bottom of the box,
[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8069) was a new $100 bill.
[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8072) She was astounded and said she knew
[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8074) she had never put it there,
[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8076) for she had gone through
the papers many times.
[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8079) It may have been a materialization,
[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8081) as Jesus Christ materialized
[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8084) the loaves and fishes.
[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8086) Man will reach the stage
[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8087) where his word is made flesh
[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8090) or materialized, instantly.
[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8092) The fields, ripe with the harvest,
[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8095) will manifest immediately
[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8096) as in all of the miracles of Jesus Christ.
[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8100) There is a tremendous power alone
[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8102) in the name Jesus Christ.
[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8104) It stands for truth made manifest.
[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8107) He said, &#39;Whatsoever ye ask the Father,
[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8110) in my name, he will give it to you.&#39;
[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8113) The power of this name raises the student
[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8115) into the fourth dimension,
[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8117) where he is freed from all astral
[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8119) and psychic influences
[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8121) and he becomes unconditioned and absolute
[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8124) as God Himself is
unconditioned and absolute.&quot;
[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8128) I have seen many healings accomplished
[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8130) by using the words,
[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8131) &#39;In the name of Jesus Christ.&#39;
[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8133) Christ was both person and principle
[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8136) and the Christ within each man
[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8138) is his Redeemer and salvation.
[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8140) The Christ within
[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8142) is his own fourth dimensional self,
[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8145) the man made in God&#39;s image and likeness.
[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8148) This is the self which has never failed,
[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8150) never known sickness or sorrow,
[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8152) was never born and has never died.
[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8155) It is the resurrection and the life
[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8158) of each man!
[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8160) &#39;No man cometh to the
Father save by the Son,&#39;
[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8163) means, that God, the universal,
[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8165) working on the place of the particular,
[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8167) becomes the Christ in man
[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8169) and the Holy Ghost means God-in-action.
[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8172) So daily, man is manifesting the Trinity
[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8175) of Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8178) Man should make an art of thinking.
[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8181) The master thinker is an artist
[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8183) and is careful to paint
only the divine designs
[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8186) upon the canvas of his mind
[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8188) and he paints these pictures
with masterly strokes
[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8191) of powder and decision,
[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8193) having perfect faith
that there is no power
[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8196) to mar their perfection
[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8197) and that they shall manifest in his life
[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8200) the ideal made real.
[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8203) All power is given man
through right thinking
[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8206) to bring his heaven upon his earth
[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8209) and this is the goal of the game of life.
[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8213) The simple rules are fearless faith,
[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8215) non-resistance and love!
[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8219) May each reader be now
freed from that thing
[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8221) which has held him in
bondage through the ages,
[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8224) standing between him and his own
[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8227) and know the truth which makes him free.
[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8230) Free to fulfill his destiny,
[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8232) to bring into manifestation
[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8234) the divine design of his life, health,
[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8237) wealth, love and perfect self-expression.
[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8241) Be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind.
[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8247) Denials and affirmations.
[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8250) For prosperity.
[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8253) God is my unfailing supply
[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8255) and large sums of money come to me quickly
[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8258) under grace in perfect ways.
[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8262) For right conditions.
[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8264) Every plan my Father in
heaven has not planned,
[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8267) shall be dissolved and dissipated
[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8269) and the divine idea now comes to pass.
[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8274) For right conditions.
[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8276) Only that which is true
of God is true of me,
[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8280) for I and the Father are one.
[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8284) For faith.
[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8286) As I am one with God,
[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8288) I am one with my good,
[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8290) for God is both the Giver and the Gift.
[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8293) I cannot separate the Giver from the gift.
[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8297) For right conditions.
[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8300) Divine love now dissolves and dissipates
[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8303) every wrong condition in my mind,
[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8305) body and affairs.
[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8308) Divine love is the most powerful chemical
[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8310) in the universe
[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8311) and dissolves everything
which is not of itself!
[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8316) For health.
[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8318) Divine love floods my
consciousness with health
[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8322) and every cell in my body
is filled with light.
[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8326) For eyesight.
[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8329) My eyes are God&#39;s eyes,
[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8331) I see with the eyes of spirit.
[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8334) I see clearly the open way,
[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8337) there are no obstacles on my pathway.
[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8340) I see clearly the perfect plan.
[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8344) For guidance.
[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8346) I am divinely sensitive
to my intuitive leads
[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8349) and give instant obedience to Thy will.
[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8354) For the hearing.
[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8356) My ears are God&#39;s ears,
[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8359) I hear with the ears of spirit.
[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8361) I am non-resistant and
am willing to be led.
[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8365) I hear glad tidings of great joy.
[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8369) For right work.
[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8371) I have a perfect work in a perfect way.
[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8375) I give a perfect service for perfect pay.
[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8379) For freedom from all bondage.
[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8383) I cast this burden on the Christ within
[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5Ch0O4BI&t=8387) and I go free!&quot;
